{"word":"Mary, Mother Of Mark","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Colossians 4:10) was sister to Barnabas. (Acts 4:36; 12:15) She was among the earliest disciples, and lived at Jerusalem. She gave up her house to be used as one of the chief places of meeting. The fact that Peter went to that house on his release from prison indicates that there was some special intimacy, (Acts 12:12) between them. (There is a tradition that the place of meeting of the disciples, and hence Mary\u0027s house, was on the upper slope of Zion, and that it was here that the Holy Ghost came upon the disciples with tongues of flame on the day of Pentecost.--ED.)"}]}
