{"word":"Shulamite, The","sections":[{"paragraph":"one of the personages in the poem of Solomon\u0027s (Song of Solomon 6:13) The name denotes a woman belonging to a place called Shulem, which is probably the same as Shunem. [[1130]Shunem] If, then, Shulamite and Shunammite are equivalent, we may conjecture that the Shunammite who was the object of Solomon\u0027s passion was Abishag, the most lovely girl of her day, and at the time of David\u0027s death the most prominent person at Jerusalem."}]}
