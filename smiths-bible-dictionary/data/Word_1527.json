(2 Kings 18:17,26) One resort of the fullers of Jerusalem would seem to have been below the city on the southeast side. But Rabshakeh and his \"great host\" must have come from the north; and the fuller\u0027s field was therefore, to judge from this circumstance, on the table-land on the northern side of the city."}]}
