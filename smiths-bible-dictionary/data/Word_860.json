{"word":"Canaanite, The","sections":[{"paragraph":"the designation of the apostle Simon, otherwise known as \"Simon Zelotes.\" It occurs in (Matthew 10:4; Mark 3:18) and is derived from a Chaldee or Syriac word by which the Jewish sect or faction of the \"Zealots\" was designated--a turbulent and seditious sect, especially conspicuous at the siege of Jerusalem. They taught that all foreign rule over Jews was unscriptural, and opposed that rule in every way."}]}
