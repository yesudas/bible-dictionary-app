{"word":"Amen","sections":[{"paragraph":"literally \"true\" and used as a substantive, \"that which is true,\" \"truth,\" (Isaiah 65:16) a word used in strong asseverations, fixing, as it were, the stamp of truth upon the assertion which it accompanied, and making it binding as an oath. Comp. (Numbers 5:22) In the synagogues and private houses it was customary for the people or members of the family who were present to say \"amen\" to the prayers which were offered. (Matthew 6:13; 1 Corinthians 14:16) And not only public prayers, but those offered in private, and doxologies, were appropriately concluded with \"amen.\" (Romans 9:5; 11:36; 15:33; 16:27; 2 Corinthians 13:14) etc."}]}
