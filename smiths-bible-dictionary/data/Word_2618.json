{"word":"Lees","sections":[{"paragraph":"the coarser parts of a liquor, its sediment or dregs. \"Wine on the lees\" means a generous, full-bodied liquor. (Isaiah 25:6) Before the wine was consumed, it was necessary to strain off the lees; such wine was then termed \"well refined.\" (Isaiah 25:6) To drink the lees, or \"dregs,\" was an expression for the endurance of extreme punishment. (Psalms 75:8)"}]}
