{"word":"Succothbenoth","sections":[{"paragraph":"Occurs only in (2 Kings 17:30) It has generally been supposed that this term is pure Hebrew, and signifies the tents of daughters; which some explain as \"the booths in which the daughters of the Babylonians prostituted themselves in honor of their idol,\" others as \"small tabernacles in which were contained images of female deities.\" Sir H. Rawlinson thinks that Succoth-benoth represents the Chaldaean goddess Zerbanit, the wife of Merodach, who was especially worshipped at Babylon."}]}
