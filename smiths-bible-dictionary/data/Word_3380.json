{"word":"Piety","sections":[{"paragraph":"This word occurs but once in the Authorized Version: \"Let them learn first to show piety at home,\" better \"toward their own household\" or family. (1 Timothy 5:4) The choice of this word here instead of the more usual equivalents -of \"godliness,\" \"reverence,\" and the like, was probably determined by the special sense of pietas, as \"erga parentes,\" i.e. toward parents."}]}
