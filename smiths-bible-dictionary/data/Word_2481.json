The Olympian Zeus was the national god of the Hellenic race, as well as the supreme ruler of the heathen world, and as such formed the true opposite to Jehovah. Jupiter or Zeus is mentioned in two passages of the New Testament, on the occasion of St. Paul\u0027s visit to Lystra, (Acts 14:12,13) where the expression \"Jupiter, which was before their city,\" means that his temple was outside the city. Also in (Acts 19:35)"}]}
