{"word":"Jareb","sections":[{"paragraph":"(adversary) is to be explained either as the proper name of a country or person, as a noun in apposition, or as a verb from a root, rub, \"to contend plead.\" All these senses are represented in the Authorized Version and the marginal readings, (Hosea 5:13; 10:6) and the east preferable has been inserted in the text. Jareb is most probably the name of some city of Assyria or another name of the country itself."}]}
