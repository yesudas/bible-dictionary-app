{"word":"Moon","sections":[{"paragraph":"The moon held an important place in the kingdom of nature, as known to the Hebrews. Conjointly with the sun, it was appointed \"for signs and for seasons, and for days and years;\" though in this respect it exercised a more important influence, if by the \"seasons\" we understand the great religious festivals of the Jews, as is particularly stated in (Psalms 104:19) and more at length in Ecclus 43:6,7. The worship of the moon prevailed extensively among the nations of the East, and under a variety of aspects. It was one of the only two deities which commanded the reverence of all the Egyptians. The worship of the heavenly bodies is referred to in (Job 31:26,27) and Moses directly warns the Jews against it. (4:19) In the figurative language of Scripture, the moon is frequently noticed as presaging events of the greatest importance through the temporary or permanent withdrawal of its light. (Isaiah 13:10; Joel 2:31; Matthew 24:29; Mark 13:24)"}]}
