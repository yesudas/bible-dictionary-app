{"word":"Dial","sections":[{"paragraph":"\"An instrument for showing the time of day from the shadow of a style or gnomon on a graduated arc or surface; \"rendered\" steps\" in Authorized Version, (Exodus 20:26; 2 Kings 10:19) and \"degrees,\" (2 Kings 20:9,10,11; Isaiah 38:8) where to give a consistent rendering we should read with the margin the \"degrees\" rather than the \"dial\" of Ahaz. It is probable that the dial of Ahaz was really a series of steps or stairs, and that the shadow (Perhaps of some column or obelisk on the top) fell on a greater or smaller number of them according as the sun was low or high. The terrace of a palace might easily be thus ornamented."}]}
