(B.C. 1094.) + In (1 Chronicles 6:36) Authorized Version, Joel seems to be merely a corruption of Shaul in ver. 24. + A Simeonite chief. (1 Chronicles 4:35) + A descendant of Reuben.

(1 Chronicles 5:12) (B.C. 782.) + The son of Izrahiah, of the tribe of Issachar. (1 Chronicles 7:3) + The brother of Nathan of Zobah, (1 Chronicles 11:38) and one of David\u0027s guard. + The chief of the Gershomites in the reign of David.

(Ezra 10:43) (B.C. 459.) + The son of Zichri, a Benjamite. (Nehemiah 11:9) + The second of the twelve minor prophets, the son of Pethuel, probably prophesied in Judah in the reign of Uzziah, about B.C. 800. The book of Joel contains a grand outline of the whole terrible scene, which was to be depicted more and more in detail by subsequent prophets. The proximate event to which the prophecy related was a public calamity, then impending on Judah, of a two-plague of locusts--and continuing for several years. The prophet exhorts the people to turn to God with penitence, fasting and prayer; and then, he says, the plague shall cease, and the rain descendent in its season, and the land yield her accustomed fruit. Nay, the time will be a most joyful one; for God, by the outpouring of his Spirit, will extend the blessings of true religion to heathen lands. The prophecy is referred to in Acts 2."}]}
