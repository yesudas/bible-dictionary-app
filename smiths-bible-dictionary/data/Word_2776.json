{"word":"Marah","sections":[{"paragraph":"(bitterness), a place which lay in the wilderness of Shur or Etham, three days journey distant, (Exodus 15:23; Numbers 33:8) from the place at which the Israelites crossed the Red Sea, and where was a spring of bitter water, sweetened subsequently by the casting in of a tree which \"the Lord showed\" to Moses. Howarah, distant 16 1/2 hours (47 miles) from Ayoun Mousa, the Israelites\u0027 first encampment, has been by many identified with it, apparently because it is the bitterest water in the neighborhood."}]}
