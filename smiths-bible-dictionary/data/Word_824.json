{"word":"Bull, Bullock","sections":[{"paragraph":"terms used synonymously with ox, oxen, and properly a generic name for horned cattle when a full age and fit for the plough. It is variously rendered \"bullock,\" (Isaiah 65:25) \"cow,\" (Ezekiel 4:15) \"oxen,\" (Genesis 12:16) Kine is used in the Bible as the plural of cow. In (Isaiah 51:20) the \"wild bull\" (\"wild ox\" in (14:5)) was possibly one of the larger species of antelope, and took its name from its swiftness.
