{"word":"Scrip","sections":[{"paragraph":"The Hebrew word thus translated appears in (1 Samuel 17:40) as a synonym for the bag in which the shepherds of Palestine carried their food or other necessities. The scrip of the Galilean peasants was of leather, used especially to carry their food on a journey, and slung over their shoulders. (Matthew 10:10; Mark 6:8; Luke 9:3; 22:35) The English word \"scrip\" is probably connected with scrape, scrap, and was used in like manner for articles of food."}]}
