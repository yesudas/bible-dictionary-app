Offensive weapons.--"},{"paragraph":"+ Apparently the earliest known and most widely used was the Chereb or [169]Sword. Very little can be gathered as to its shape, size, material or mode of use. Perhaps if anything is to be inferred it is that the Chereb is both a lighter and a shorter weapon than the modern sword. It was carried in a sheath, (1 Samuel 17:51; 2 Samuel 20:8; 1 Chronicles 21:27) slung by a girdle, (1 Samuel 25:13) and resting upon the thigh, (Psalms 45:3; Judges 3:16) or upon the hips. (2 Samuel 20:8) + Next we have the [170]Spear; and of this weapon we meet with at least three distinct kinds. A. The Chanith, a \"spear,\" and that of the largest kind. It was the weapon of Goliath, (1 Samuel 17:7,45; 2 Samuel 21:19; 1 Chronicles 20:5) and also of other giants, (2 Samuel 23:21; 1 Chronicles 11:23) and mighty warriors. (2 Samuel 2:23; 23:18; 1 Chronicles 11:11,20) b. Apparently lighter than the preceding was the Cidon or \"javelin.\" When not in action the Cidon was carried on the back of the warrior, (1 Samuel 17:6) Authorized Version \"target.\" c. Another kind of spear was the Romach . In the historical books it occurs in (Numbers 25:7) and 1Kin 18:28 And frequently in the later books, as in (1 Chronicles 12:8) (\"buckler\"); (2 Chronicles 11:12) (It varied much in length, weight and size.) d. The Shelach was probably a lighter missile or \"dart.\" see (2 Chronicles 23:10; 32:5) (\"darts\"); (Nehemiah 4:17,23) (see margin); (Job 33:18; 36:12; Joel 2:8) e. Shebet, a rod or staff, is used once only to denote a weapon. (2 Samuel 18:14) + Of missile weapons of offence the chief was undoubtedly the [171]Bow, Kesheth . The [172]Arrows were carried in a quiver. (Genesis 27:3; Isaiah 22:6; 49:2; Psalms 127:5) From an allusion in Job 6:4 they would seem to have been some times poisoned; and (Psalms 120:4) may point to a practice of using arrows with some burning material attached to them. + The [173]Sling is first mentioned in (Judges 20:16) This simple weapon, with which David killed the giant Philistine, was the natural attendant of a shepherd. Later in the monarchy, slingers formed part of the regular army. (2 Kings 3:25) + The BATTLE AXE, (Jeremiah 51:20) a powerful weapon of whose exact form we have no knowledge. II. Armor.-- + The [174]Breastplate, enumerated in the description of the arms of Goliath, a \"coat of mail,\" literally a \"breastplate of scales.\" (1 Samuel 17:5) This word has furnished one of the names of Mount Hermon. See (3:9) + The [175]Habergeon is mentioned but twice--in reference to the gown of the high priest. (Exodus 28:32; 39:28) It was probably a quilted shirt or doublet. + The [176]Helmet is referred to in (1 Samuel 17:5; 2 Chronicles 26:14; Ezekiel 27:10) + ([177]Greaves) or defences for the feet, made of brass, are named in (1 Samuel 17:6) only. + Two kinds of [178]Shield are distinguishable. A. The large shield; encompassing, (Psalms 6:12) the whole person. When not in actual conflict it was carried before the warrior. (1 Samuel 17:7,41) b. Of smaller dimensions was the buckler or target, probably for use in hand-to-hand fight. (1 Kings 10:16; 2 Chronicles 9:15,16)"}]}
