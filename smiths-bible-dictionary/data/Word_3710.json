{"word":"Sechu","sections":[{"paragraph":"(the watch-tower), a place mentioned once only-- (1 Samuel 19:22)--apparently as lying on the route between Saul\u0027s residence, Gibeah, and Ramah (Ramathaim-zophim), that of Samuel. It was notorious for \"the great well\" (or rather cistern) which it contained. Assuming that Saul started from Gibeah (Tuleil el-Ful), and that Neby Samwil is Ramah, then Bir Nebolla (the well of Neballa) just south of Beeroth, alleged by modern traveller to contain a large pit would be in a suitable position for the great well of Sechu."}]}
