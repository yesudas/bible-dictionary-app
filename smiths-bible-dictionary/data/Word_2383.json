{"word":"Joab","sections":[{"paragraph":"(whose father is Jehovah), the most remarkable of the three nephews of David, the children of Zeruiah, David\u0027s sister. (B.C. 1053-1012.) Joab first appears after David\u0027s accession to the throne at Hebron. Abner slew in battle Asahel, the youngest brother of Joab; and when David afterward received Abner into favor, Joab treacherously murdered him. [[731]Abner] There was now no rival left in the way of Joab\u0027s advancement, and at the siege of Jebus he was appointed for his prowess commander-in-chief--\"captain of the host.\" In the wide range of wars which David undertook, Joab was the acting general. He was called by the almost regal title of \"lord,\" (2 Samuel 11:11) \"the prince of the king\u0027s army.\" (1 Chronicles 27:34) In the entangled relations which grew up in David\u0027s domestic life he bore an important part, successfully reinstating Absalom in David\u0027s favor after the murder of Amnon. (2 Samuel 14:1-20) When the relations between father and son were reversed by the revolt of Absalom, Joab remained true to the king, taking the rebel prince\u0027s dangerous life in spite of David\u0027s injunction to spare him, and when no one else had courage to act so decisive a part. (2 Samuel 18:2,11-15) (B.C. 1023). The king transferred the command to Amasa, which so enraged Joab that he adroitly assassinated Amasa when pretending to welcome him as a friend. (2 Samuel 20:10) Friendly relations between himself and David seem to have existed afterward, (2 Samuel 24:2) but at the close of his long life, his loyalty, so long unshaken, at last wavered. \"Though he had not turned after Absalom, he turned after Adonijah.\" (1 Kings 2:28) This probably filled up the measure of the king\u0027s long-cherished resentment. The revival of the pretensions of Adonijah after David\u0027s death was sufficient to awaken the suspicions of Solomon. Joab fled to the shelter of the altar at Gibeon, and was here slain by Benaiah. (B.C. about 1012.)"},{"paragraph":"+ One of Kenaz\u0027s descendants. (1 Chronicles 4:14) + (Ezra 2:6; 8:9; Nehemiah 7:11)"}]}
