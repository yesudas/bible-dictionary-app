{"word":"Kite","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Heb. ayyah), a rapacious and keen-sighted bird of prey belonging to the hawk family. The Hebrew word thus rendered occurs in three passages-- (Leviticus 11:14; 14:13; Job 28:7) In the two former it is translated \"kite\" in the Authorized Version, in the latter \"vulture.\" It is enumerated among the twenty names of birds mentioned in (14:1) ... which were considered unclean by the Mosaic law and forbidden to be used as food by the Israelites."}]}
