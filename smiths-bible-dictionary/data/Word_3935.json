{"word":"Shoshannim","sections":[{"paragraph":"(lilies). \"To the chief musician upon Shoshannim\" is a musical direction to the leader of the temple choir which occurs in (Psalms 45:1; 69:1) and most probably indicates the melody \"after\" or \"in the manner of\" (Authorized Version upon\") which the psalms were to be sung. Shoshannim-eduth occurs in the same way in the title of (Psalms 80:1) ... As the words now stand they signify \"lilies, a testimony,\" and the two are separated by a large distinctive accent. In themselves they have no meaning in the present text, and must therefore be regarded as probably a fragment of the beginning of an older psalm with which the choir were familiar."}]}
