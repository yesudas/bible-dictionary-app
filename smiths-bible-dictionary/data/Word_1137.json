{"word":"Deborah","sections":[{"paragraph":"(a bee). (B.C. 1857.)"},{"paragraph":"+ The nurse of Rebekah. (Genesis 35:8) Deborah accompanied Rebekah from the house of Bethuel, (Genesis 24:59) and is only mentioned by name on the occasion of her burial under the oak tree of Bethel, which was called in her honor Allon-bachuth. + A prophetess who judged Israel. Judges 4,5. (B.C, 1316.) She lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in Mount Ephraim, (Judges 4:5) which, as palm trees were rare in Palestine, \"is mentioned as a well-known and solitary landmark.\" She was probably a woman of Ephraim. Lapidoth was probably her husband, and not Barak as some say. She was not so much a judge as one gifted with prophetic command (Judges 4:6,14; 5:7) and by virtue of her inspiration \"a mother in Israel.\" The tyranny of Jabin, a Canaanitish king, was peculiarly felt in the northern tribes, who were near his capital and under her jurisdiction. Under her direction Barak encamped on the broad summit of Tabor. Deborah\u0027s prophecy was fulfilled, (Judges 4:9) and the enemy\u0027s general perished among the \"oaks of the wanderers\" (Zaanaim), in the tent of the Bedouin Kenite\u0027s wife, (Judges 4:21) in the northern mountains. Deborah\u0027s title of \"prophetess\" includes the notion of inspired poetry, as in (Exodus 15:20) and in this sense the glorious triumphal ode, Judges 5, well vindicates her claim to the office."}]}
