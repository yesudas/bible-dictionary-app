{"word":"Enchantments","sections":[{"paragraph":"The words so translated have several signification: the practice of secret arts, (Exodus 7:11,22; 8:7); \"muttered spells,\" (2 Kings 9:22; Micah 5:12) the charming of serpents, (Ecclesiastes 10:11) the enchantments sought by Balaam, (Numbers 24:1) the use of magic, (Isaiah 47:9,12) Any resort to these methods of imposture was strictly forbidden in Scripture, (Leviticus 19:26; Isaiah 47:9) etc.; but to eradicate the tendency is almost impossible, (2 Kings 17:17) and we find it still flourishing at the Christian era.
