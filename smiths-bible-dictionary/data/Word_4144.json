{"word":"Tarsus","sections":[{"paragraph":"the chief town of Cilicia, \"no mean city\" in other respects, but illustrious to all time as the birthplace and early residence of the apostle Paul. (Acts 9:11; 21:39; 22:3) Even in the flourishing period of Greek history it was a city of some considerable consequence. In the civil wars of Rome it took Caesar\u0027s aide, sad on the occasion of a visit from him had its name changed to Juliopolis. Augustus made it a \"free city.\" It was renowned as a place of education under the early Roman emperors. Strabo compares it in this respect to Athens unto Alexandria. Tarsus also was a place of much commerce. It was situated in a wild and fertile plain on the banks of the Cydnus. No ruins of any importance remain."}]}
