{"word":"Neapolis","sections":[{"paragraph":"(new city) is the place in northern Greece where Paul and his associates first landed in Europe. (Acts 16:11) where, no doubt, he landed also on his second visit to Macedonia, (Acts 20:1) and whence certainly he embarked on his last journey through that province to Troas and Jerusalem. (Acts 20:6) Philippi being an inland town, Neapolis was evidently the port, and is represented by the present Kavalla . (Kavalla is a city of 5000 or 6000 inhabitants, Greeks and Turks. Neapolis was situated within the bounds of Thrace, ten miles from Philippi, on a high rocky promontory jutting out into the AEgean Sea, while a temple of Diana crowned the hill-top.--ED.)"}]}
