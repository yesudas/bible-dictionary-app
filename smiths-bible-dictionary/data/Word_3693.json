{"word":"Sceptre","sections":[{"paragraph":"This word originally meant a rod or staff . It was thence specifically applied to the shepherd\u0027s crook, (Leviticus 27:32; Micah 7:14) and to the wand or sceptre of a ruler. The allusions to it are all of a metaphorical character, and describe it simply as one of the insignia of supreme power. (Genesis 49:10) We are consequently unable to describe the article from any biblical notice we may infer that it was probably made of wood. The sceptre of the Persian monarch is described as \"golden\" i.e. probably of massive gold. (Esther 4:11)"}]}
