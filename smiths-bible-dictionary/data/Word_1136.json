The earlier name of Debir was Kirjath-sepher, \"city of book,\" (Joshua 15:15; Judges 1:11) and Kirjath-sannah, \"city of palm.\" (Joshua 15:49) It was one of the cities given with their \"suburbs\" to the priests. (Joshua 21:15; 1 Chronicles 6:58) Debir has not been discovered with certainty in modern times; but about three miles to the west of Hebron is a deep and secluded valley called the Wady Nunkur, enclosed on the north by hills, of which one bears a name certainly suggestive of Debir--Dewir-ban. + A place on the north boundary of Judah, near the \"valley of Achor.\" (Joshua 15:7) A Wady Dabor is marked in Van Deuteronomy Velde\u0027s map as close to the south of Neby Musa, at the northwest corner of the Dead Sea. + The \"border of Debir\" is named as forming part of the boundary of Gad, (Joshua 13:26) and as apparently not far from Mahanaim."}]}
