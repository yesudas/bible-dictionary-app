{"word":"Brass","sections":[{"paragraph":"The word nechosheth is improperly translated by \"brass.\" In most places of the Old Testament the correct translation would be copper, although it may sometimes possibly mean bronze a compound of copper and tin. Indeed a simple metal was obviously intended, as we see from (8:9; 33:25; Job 28) Copper was known at a very early period. (Genesis 4:22)"}]}
