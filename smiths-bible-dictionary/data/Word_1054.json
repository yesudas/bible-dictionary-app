{"word":"Cormorant","sections":[{"paragraph":"the representative in the Authorized Version of the Hebrew words kaath and shalac . As to the former, see [404]Pelican. Shalac occurs only as the name of an unclean bird in (Leviticus 11:17; 14:17) The word has been variously rendered. The etymology points to some plunging bird. The common cormorant (phalacrocorax carbo), which some writers have identified with the shalac, is unknown in the eastern Mediterranean; another species is found south of the Red Sea, but none on the west coast of Palestine."}]}
