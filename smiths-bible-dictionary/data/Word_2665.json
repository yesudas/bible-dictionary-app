{"word":"Lords Prayer","sections":[{"paragraph":"the prayer which Jesus taught his disciples. (Matthew 6:9-13; Luke 11:2-4) \"In this prayer our Lord shows his disciples how an infinite variety of wants and requests can be compressed into a few humble petitions. It embodies every possible desire of a praying heart, a whole world of spiritual requirements; yet all in the most simple, condensed and humble form, resembling, in this respect, a pearl on which the light of heaven plays.\"--Lange. \"This prayer contains four great general sentiments, which constitute the very soul of religion,--sentiments which are the germs of all holy deeds in all worlds. (1) Filial reverence : God is addressed not as the great unknown, not as the unsearchable governor, but as a father, the most intelligible, attractive and transforming name. It is a form of address almost unknown to the old covenant, now an then hinted at as reminding the children of their rebellion. (Isaiah 1:2); Mali 1:6 Or mentioned as a last resource of the orphan and desolate creature, (Isaiah 63:16) but never brought out in its fullness, as indeed it could not be, till he was come by whom we have received the adoption of sons.\"--Alford. (2) \"Divine loyalty : \u0027Thy kingdom come.\u0027 (3) Conscious dependence : \u0027Give us this day,\u0027 etc. (4) Unbounded confidence : \u0027For thine is the power,\u0027 etc.\"--Dr. Thomas\u0027 Genius of the Gospels. The doxology, \"For thine is the kingdom\" etc., is wanting in many manuscripts. It is omitted in the Revised Version; but it nevertheless has the authority of some manuscripts, and is truly biblical, almost every word being found in (1 Chronicles 29:11) and is a true and fitting ending for prayer."}]}
