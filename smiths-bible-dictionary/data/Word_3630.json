{"word":"Sackbut","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Daniel 3:5,7,10,15) the rendering in the Authorized Version of the Chaldee sacbbeca . If this music instrument be the same as the Greek and Latin sabbeca, the English translation is entirely wrong. The sackbut was a wind instrument [see [1033]Music]; the sambuca was a triangular instrument, with strings, and played with the hand."}]}
