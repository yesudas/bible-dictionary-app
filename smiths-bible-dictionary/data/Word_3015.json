{"word":"Mulbury Trees","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Heb. becaim). Mention of these is made only in (2 Samuel 5:23,24) and 1Chr 14:14 We are quite unable to determine what kind of tree is denoted by the Hebrew word. Some believe pear trees are meant; others the aspen or poplar, whose leaves tremble and rustle with the slightest breeze, even when the breeze is not otherwise perceptible. It may have been to the rustling of these leaves that the \"going in the tree tops\" refers. (2 Samuel 5:23,24)"}]}
