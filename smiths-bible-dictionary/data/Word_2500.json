{"word":"Kedesh","sections":[{"paragraph":"(a sanctuary)."},{"paragraph":"+ In the extreme south of Judah, (Joshua 15:23) same as Kadesh and Kadesh-barnea. + A city of Issachar, allotted to the Gershonite Levites. (1 Chronicles 6:72) The Kadesh mentioned among the cities whose kings were slain by Joshua, (Joshua 12:22) in company with Megiddo and Jokneam of Carmel, would seem to have been this city of Issachar. + Kedesh; also Kedesh in Galilee; and once, (Judges 4:6) Kedesh-naphtali, one of the fortified cities of the tribe of Naphtali, named between Hazor and Edrei, (Joshua 19:37) appointed as a city of refuge, and allotted with its \"suburbs\" to the Gershonite Levites. (Joshua 20:7; 21:32; 1 Chronicles 6:76) It was the residence of Barak, (Judges 4:6) and there he and Deborah assembled the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali before the conflict, being probably, as its name implies, a \"holy place\" of great antiquity. It was taken by Tiglath-pileser in the reign of Pekah. (2 Kings 15:29) It is identified with the village Kades, which lies four miles to the northwest of the upper part of the Sea of Merom."}]}
