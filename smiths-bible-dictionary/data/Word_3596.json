(Genesis 15:18) [[1027]Nile] + A desert stream on the border of Egypt, still occasionally flowing in the valley called Wadi-l-\u0027Areesh .

This stream is first mentioned as the point where the southern border of the promised land touched the Mediterranean, which formed its western border. (Numbers 34:3-6) In the latter history we find Solomon\u0027s kingdom extending from the \"entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt,\" (1 Kings 8:65) and Egypt limited in the same manner where the loss of the eastern provinces is mentioned.
