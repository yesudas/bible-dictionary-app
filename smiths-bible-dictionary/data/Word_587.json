{"word":"Bashan","sections":[{"paragraph":"(fruitful), a district on the east of Jordan. It is sometimes spoken of as the \"land of Bashan,\" (1 Chronicles 5:11) and comp. Numb 21:33; 32:33 And sometimes as \"all Bashan.\" (3:10,13; Joshua 12:5; 13:12,30) It was taken by the children of Israel after their conquest of the land of Sihon from Arnon to Jabbok. The limits of Bashan are very strictly defined. It extended from the \"border of Gilead\" on the south to Mount Hermon on the north, (3:3,10,14; Joshua 12:5; 1 Chronicles 5:23) and from the Arabah or Jordan valley on the west to Salchah (Sulkhad) and the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites on the east. (Joshua 12:3-5; 3:10) This important district was bestowed on the half-tribe of Manasseh, (Joshua 13:29-31) together with \"half Gilead.\" This country is now full of interesting ruins, which have lately been explored and from which much light has been thrown upon Bible times. See Porter\u0027s \"Giant Cities of Bashan.\""}]}
