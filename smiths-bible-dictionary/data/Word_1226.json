{"word":"Earthquake","sections":[{"paragraph":"Earthquakes, more or less violent, are of frequent occurrence in Palestine. The most remarkable occurred in the reign of Uzziah. (Zechariah 14:5) From (Zechariah 14:4) we are led to infer that a great convulsion took place at this time in the Mount of Olives, the mountain being split so as to leave a valley between its summit. An earthquake occurred at the time of our Saviour\u0027s crucifixion. (Matthew 27:51-54) Earthquakes are not unfrequently accompanied by fissures of the earth\u0027s surface; instances of this are recorded in connection with the destruction of Korah and his company, (Numbers 16:32) and at the time of our Lord\u0027s death, (Matthew 27:51) the former may be paralleled by a similar occurrence at Oppido in Calabria A.D. 1783, where the earth opened to the extent of five hundred and a depth of more than two hundred feet."}]}
