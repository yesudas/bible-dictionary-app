{"word":"Poplar","sections":[{"paragraph":"This is the rendering of the Hebrew word libneh, which occurs in (Genesis 30:37) and Hose 4:13 Several authorities are in favor of the rendering of the Authorized Version and think that \"white poplar\" (Populus alba) is the tree denoted: others understand the \"storax tree\" (Styrax officinale, Linn.). Both poplars and storax or styrax trees are common in Palestine, and either would suit the passages where the Hebrew term occurs. Storax is mentioned in Ecclus. 24:15, together with other aromatic substances. The Styrax officinale is a shrub from nine to twelve feet high, with ovate leaves, which are white underneath; the flowers are in racemes, and are white or cream-colored."}]}
