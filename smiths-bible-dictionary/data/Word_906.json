(2 Chronicles 26:19; Luke 1:9) The only distinct precepts regarding the use of the censer are found in (Leviticus 16:12) and in (Numbers 4:14) Solomon prepared \"censers of pure gold\" as part of the temple furniture. (1 Kings 7:50; 2 Chronicles 4:22) The word rendered \"censer\" in (Hebrews 9:4) probably means the \"altar of incense.\""}]}
