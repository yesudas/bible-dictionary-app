{"word":"Pelonite, The","sections":[{"paragraph":"Two of David\u0027s men, Helez and Ahijah, are called Pelonites. (1 Chronicles 11:27,36) (B.C. about 1015.) From (1 Chronicles 27:10) it appears that the former was of the tribe of Ephraim, and \"Pelonite\" would therefore be an appellation derived from his place of birth or residence. \"Ahijah the Pelonite\" appears in (2 Samuel 23:34) as \"Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,\" of which the former is a corruption."}]}
