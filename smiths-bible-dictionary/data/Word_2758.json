{"word":"Man","sections":[{"paragraph":"Four Hebrew terms are rendered \"man\" in the Authorized Version:"},{"paragraph":"+ Adam, the name of the man created in the image of God. It appears to be derived from adam, \"he or it was red or ruddy,\" like Edom. This was the generic term for the human race. + Ish, \"man,\" as distinguished from woman, husband. + Geber, \"a man,\" from gabar, \"to be strong,\" generally with reference to his strength. + Methim, \"men,\" always masculine. Perhaps it may be derived from the root muth, \"he died.\""}]}
