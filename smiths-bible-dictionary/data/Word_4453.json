{"word":"Zarthan","sections":[{"paragraph":"+ A place in the circle of Jordan, mentioned in connection with Succoth. (1 Kings 7:46) + It is also named in the account of the passage of the Jordan by the Israelites, (Joshua 3:18) where the authorized Version has Zaretan. + A place with the similar name of Zartanah. (1 Kings 4:12) + Further, Zeredathah, named in (2 Chronicles 4:17) only in specifying the situation of the foundries for the brass-work of Solomon\u0027s temple, is substituted for Zarthan; and this again is not impossibly identical with the Zererath of the story of Gideon. (Judges 7:22) All these spots agree in proximity to the Jordan, but beyond this we are absolutely at fault as to their position."}]}
