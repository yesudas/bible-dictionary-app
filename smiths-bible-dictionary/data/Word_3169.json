{"word":"Oak","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Heb. strong). There is much difficulty in determining the exact meanings of the several varieties of the term mentioned above.

(Dr. Robinson contends that the oak is generally intended, and that it is a very common tree in the East. Oaks grow to a large size, reach an old age and are every way worthy the venerable associations connected with the tree.--ED.)
