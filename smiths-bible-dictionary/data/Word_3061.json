{"word":"Nain","sections":[{"paragraph":"(beauty), a village of Galilee, the gate of which is made illustrious by the raising of the widow\u0027s son. (Luke 7:12) The modern Nein is situated on the northwestern edge of the \"Little Hermon,\" or Jebel-ed-Duhy, where the ground falls into the plain of Esdraelon. The entrance to the place, where our Saviour met the funeral, must probably always have seen up the steep ascent from the plain; and here on the west side of the village, the rock is full of sepulchral caves."}]}
