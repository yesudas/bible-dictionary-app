{"word":"Harrow","sections":[{"paragraph":"The word so rendered, (2 Samuel 12:31; 1 Chronicles 20:3) is probably a threshing-machine. The verb rendered \"to harrow,\" (Job 39:10; Isaiah 28:24; Hosea 10:11) expresses apparently the breaking of the clods, and is so far analogous to our harrowing--but whether done by any such machine as we call a \"harrow\" is very doubtful."}]}
