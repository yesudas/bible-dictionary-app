{"word":"Madness","sections":[{"paragraph":"In Scripture \"madness\" is recognized as a derangement proceeding either from weakness and misdirection of intellect or from ungovernable violence of passion. In one passage alone, (John 10:20) is madness expressly connected with demoniacal possession by the Jews in their cavil against our Lord; in none is it referred to any physical causes."}]}
