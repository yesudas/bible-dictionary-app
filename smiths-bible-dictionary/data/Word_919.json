{"word":"Chamberlain","sections":[{"paragraph":"an officer attached to the court of a king, who formerly had charge of the private apartments or chambers of the palace. He kept the accounts of the public revenues. The office held by Blastus, \"the king\u0027s chamberlain,\" was entirely different from this. (Acts 12:20) It was a post of honor which involved great intimacy and influence with the king. For chamberlain as used in the Old Testament, see [[359]Eunuch]"}]}
