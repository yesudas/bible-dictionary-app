{"word":"Jacobs Well","sections":[{"paragraph":"a deep spring in the vicinity of Shechem (called Sychar in Christ\u0027s time and Nablus at the present day). It was probably dug by Jacob whose name it bears. On the curb of the well Jesus sat and discoursed with the Samaritan woman. (John 4:5-26) It is situated about half a mile southeast of Nablus, at the foot of Mount Gerizim. It is about nine feet in diameter and 75 feet deep. At some seasons it is dry; at others it contains a few feet of water."}]}
