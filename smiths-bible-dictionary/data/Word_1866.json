{"word":"Hazor","sections":[{"paragraph":"(castle)."},{"paragraph":"+ A fortified city, which on the occupation of the country was allotted to Naphtali. (Joshua 19:36) Its position was apparently between Ramah and Kedesh, ibid. (Joshua 12:19) on the high ground overlooking the Lake of Merom. There is no reason for supposing it a different place from that of which Jabin was king. (Joshua 11:1; Judges 4:2,17; 1 Samuel 12:9) It was the principal city of the whole of north Palestine. (Joshua 11:10) It was fortified by Solomon, (1 Kings 9:15) and its inhabitants were carried captive by Tiglath-pileser. (2 Kings 15:29) The most probable site of Hazor is Tell Khuraibeh . + One of the \"cities\" of Judah in the extreme south, named next in order to Kedesh. (Joshua 15:23) + Hazor-Hadattah \u003d \"new Hazor\" another of the southern towns of Judah. (Joshua 15:25) + A place in which the Benjamites resided after their return from the captivity. (Nehemiah 11:33)"}]}
