{"word":"Rebekah","sections":[{"paragraph":"(ensnarer), daughter of Bethuel, (Genesis 22:23) and sister of Laban, married to Isaac. She is first presented to us in (Genesis 24:1) ... where the beautiful story of her marriage is related. (B.C. 1857.) For nineteen years she was childless: then Esau and Jacob were born, the younger being the mother\u0027s companion and favorite. (Genesis 25:19-28) Rebekah suggested the deceit that was practiced by Jacob on his blind father. She directed and aided him in carrying it out, foresaw the probable consequence of Esau\u0027s anger, and prevented it by moving Isaac to send Jacob away to Padan-aram, (Genesis 27:1) ... to her own kindred. (Genesis 29:12) Rebekah\u0027s beauty became at one time a source of danger to her husband. (Genesis 26:7) It has been conjectured that she died during Jacob\u0027s sojourn in Padan-aram."}]}
