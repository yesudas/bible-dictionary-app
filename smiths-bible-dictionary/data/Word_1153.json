{"word":"Denarius","sections":[{"paragraph":"(containing ten), Authorized Version \"penny,\" (Matthew 18:28; 20:2,9,13) a Roman silver coin in the time of our Saviour and the Apostles, worth about 15 cents. It took its name from its being first equal to ten \"asses,\" a number afterwards increased to sixteen. It was the principal silver coin of the Roman commonwealth. From the parable of the laborers in the vineyard it would seem that a denarius was then the ordinary pay for a day\u0027s labor. (Matthew 20:2,4,7,9,10,13)"}]}
