{"word":"Terah","sections":[{"paragraph":"(station), the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran, and through them the ancestor of the great families of the Israelites, Ishmaelites, Midianites, Moabites and Ammonites. (Genesis 11:24-32) The account given of him in the Old Testament narrative is very brief. We learn from it simply that he was an idolater, (Joshua 24:2) that he dwelt beyond the Euphrates in Ur of the Chaldees, (Genesis 11:28) and that in the southwesterly migration, which from some unexplained cause he undertook in his old age, he went with his son Abram, his daughter-in-law Sarai, and his grandson Lot, \"to go into the land of Canaan, and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.\" (Genesis 11:31) And finally, \"the days of Terah were two hundred and five years; and Terah died in Haran.\" (Genesis 11:32) (B.C. 1921.)"}]}
