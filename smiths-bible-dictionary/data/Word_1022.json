{"word":"Coelesyria","sections":[{"paragraph":"(hollow Syria), the remarkable valley or hollow which intervenes between Libanus and Anti-Libanus, stretching a distance of nearly a hundred miles. The only mention of the region as a separate tract of country which the Jewish Scriptures contain is probably that in (Amos 1:5) where \"the inhabitants of the plain of Aven\" are threatened in conjunction with those of Damascus. The word is given in the Authorized Version as CELO-SYRIA."}]}
