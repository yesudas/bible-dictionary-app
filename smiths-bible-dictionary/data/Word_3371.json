{"word":"Phut, Put","sections":[{"paragraph":"(a bow) the third name in the list of the sons of Ham (Genesis 10:6; 1 Chronicles 1:8) elsewhere applied to an African country or people. The few mentions of Phut in the Bible clearly indicate a country or people of Africa, and, it must be added, probably not far from Egypt. (Isaiah 66:19; Jeremiah 46:9; Ezekiel 27:10; 30:5; 38:5; Nahum 3:9) Some identify it with Libya, in the northern part Africa near the Mediterranean Sea; others, as Mr. Poole, with Nubia, south of Egypt."}]}
