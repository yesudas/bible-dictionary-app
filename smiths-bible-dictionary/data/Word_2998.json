{"word":"Moreh","sections":[{"paragraph":"(teacher)."},{"paragraph":"+ The plain or plains (or, as it should rather be rendered, the oak or oaks) of Moreh. The oak of Moreh was the first recorded halting-place of Abram after his entrance into the land of Canaan. (Genesis 12:6) It was at the \"place of Shechem,\" ch. (Genesis 12:6) close to the mountains of Ebal and Gerizim. (11:30) + The hill of Moreh, at the foot of which the Midianites and Amalekites were encamped before Gideon\u0027s attack upon them. (Judges 7:1) It lay in the valley of Jezreel, rather on the north side of the valley, and north also of the eminence on which Gideon\u0027s little band of heroes was clustered. These conditions are most accurately fulfilled if we assume Jebel ed-Duhy, the \"Little Hermon\" of the modern travellers, 1815 feet above the Mediterranean, to be Moreh, the Ain-Jalood to be the spring of Harod, and Gideon\u0027s position to have been on the northeast slope of Jebel Fukua (Mount Gilboa), between the village of Nuris and the last-mentioned spring."}]}
