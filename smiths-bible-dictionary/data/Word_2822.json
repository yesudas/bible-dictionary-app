{"word":"Meadow","sections":[{"paragraph":"+ In (Genesis 41:2,18) meadow appears to be an Egyptian term meaning some kind of flag or waterplant, as its use in (Job 8:11) (Authorized Version \"flag\") seems to show. + In (Judges 20:33) the sense of the Hebrew word translated meadow is doubly uncertain. The most plausible interpretation is that of the Peshito-Syriac, which by a slight difference in the vowel-points makes the word mearah, \"the cave.\""}]}
