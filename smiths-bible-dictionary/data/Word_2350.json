{"word":"Jether","sections":[{"paragraph":"(his excellence)."},{"paragraph":"+ Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses. (Exodus 4:18) (B.C. 1530.) + The first-born of Gideon\u0027s seventy sons. (Judges 8:20) (B.C. 1256.) + The father of Amasa, captain-general of Absalom\u0027s army. (B.C. 1023.) Jether is another form of [715]Ithra. (2 Samuel 17:25) He is described in (1 Chronicles 2:17) as an Ishmaelite, which again is more likely to be correct than the \"Israelite\" of the Hebrew in (2 Samuel 17:1) ... + The son of Jada, a descendant of Hezron, of the tribe of Judah. (1 Chronicles 2:32) + The son of Ezra. (1 Chronicles 2:32) + The chief of a family of warriors of the line of Asher, and father of Jephunneh. (1 Chronicles 7:38) He is probably the same as [716]Ithran in the preceding verse."}]}
