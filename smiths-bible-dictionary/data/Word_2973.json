{"word":"Mixed Multitude","sections":[{"paragraph":"When the Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, the first stage of the exodus from Egypt, there were up with them \"a mixed multitude.\" (Exodus 12:38; Numbers 11:4) They were probably the offspring of marriages contracted between the Israelites and the Egyptians; and the term may also include all those who were not of pure Israelite blood. In Exodus and Numbers it probably denoted the miscellaneous hangers-on of the Hebrew camp, whether they were the issue of spurious marriages with Egyptians or were themselves Egyptians, or belonging to other nations. The same happened on the return from Babylon, and in (Nehemiah 13:3) (comp. vs Nehe 13:23-30) a slight clue is given by which the meaning of the \"mixed multitude\" may be more definitely ascertained."}]}
