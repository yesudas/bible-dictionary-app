(Exodus 28:27) The sard, which is probably the stone denoted by odem, is a superior variety of agate, sometimes called camelian, and has long been a favorite stone for the engraver\u0027s art. Sardis differ in color: there is a bright-red variety, and perhaps the Hebrew odem from a root means \"to be red,\" points to this kind."}]}
