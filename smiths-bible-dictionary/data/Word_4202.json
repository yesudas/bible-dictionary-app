{"word":"Three Taverns","sections":[{"paragraph":"A station on the Appian Road, along which St. Paul travelled from Puteoli to Rome. (Acts 28:15) The distances, reckoning southward from Rome are given as follows in the Antonine Itinerary: \"to Aricia, 16 miles; to Three Taverns, 17 miles; to Appii Forum, 10 miles;\" and, comparing this with what is still observed along the line of road, we have no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that \"Three Taverns\" was near the modern Cisterna . Just at this point a road came in from Antium on the coast. There is no doubt that \"Three Taverns\" was a frequent meeting-place of travellers."}]}
