{"word":"Uzza","sections":[{"paragraph":"(strength)."},{"paragraph":"+ A Benjamite of the sons of Ehud. (1 Chronicles 8:7) (B.C. 1445.) + Elsewhere called [1259]Uzza, Or Uzzah. (1 Chronicles 13:7,9,10,11) [[1260]Uzza, Or Uzzah] + The children of Uzza were a family of Nethinim who returned with Zerubbabel. (Ezra 2:49; Nehemiah 7:51) (B.C. before 536.) + Properly Uzzah. As the text now stands, Uzzah is a descendant of Merari, (1 Chronicles 6:29) (14); but there appears to be a gap in the verse. Perhaps he is the same as Zina or Zizah the son of Shimei. (1 Chronicles 23:10,11) for these names evidently denote the same person, and, in Hebrew character, are not unlike Uzzah."}]}
