{"word":"Leaf, Leaves","sections":[{"paragraph":"The word occurs in the Authorized Version either in singular or plural number in three different senses."},{"paragraph":"+ Leaf of a tree. The righteous are often compared to green leaves. (Jeremiah 17:8) The ungodly, on the other hand, are \"as an oak whose leaf fadeth.\" (Isaiah 1:30) + Leaves of doors. The hebrew word, which occurs very many times in the Bible, and which in (1 Kings 6:32) (margin) and 1Kin 6:34 Is translated \"leaves\" in the Authorized Version, signifies beams, ribs, sides, etc. + Leaves of a book or roll occurs in this sense only in (Jeremiah 36:23) The Hebrew word (literally doors) would perhaps be more correctly translated columns."}]}
