{"word":"Roll","sections":[{"paragraph":"A book in ancient times consisted of a single long strip of paper or parchment, which was usually kept rolled upon a stick, and was unrolled when a person wished to read it. The roll was usually written on one side only, and hence the particular notice of one that was \"written within and without.\" (Ezekiel 2:10) The writing was arranged in columns."}]}
