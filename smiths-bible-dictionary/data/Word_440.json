{"word":"Asherah","sections":[{"paragraph":"(straight), the name of a Phoenician goddess, or rather of the idol itself (Authorized Version \"grove\"). Asherah is closely connected with [199]Ashtoreth and her worship, (Judges 3:7) comp. Judg 2:3; 6:25; 1Kin 18:19 Ashtoreth being, perhaps, the proper name of the goddess, whilst Asherah is the name of her image or symbol, which was of wood. See (Judges 6:25-30; 2 Kings 23:14)"}]}
