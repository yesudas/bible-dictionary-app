{"word":"Mesech, Meshech","sections":[{"paragraph":"(drawing out), a son of Japhet, (Genesis 10:2; 1 Chronicles 1:5) and the progenitor of a race frequently noticed in Scripture in connection with Tubal, Magog and other northern nations. They appear as allies of God, (Ezekiel 38:2,3; 39:1) and as supplying the Tyrians with copper and slaves. (Ezekiel 27:13) In (Psalms 120:5) they are noticed as one of the remotest and at the same time rudest nations of the world. Both the name and the associations are in favor of the identification of Meshech with the Moschi, a people on the borders of Colchis and Armenia."}]}
