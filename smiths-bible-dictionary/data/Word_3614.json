{"word":"Rue","sections":[{"paragraph":"occurs only in (Luke 11:42) The rue here spoken of is doubtless the common Ruta graveolens a shrubby plant about two feet high, of strong medicinal virtues. It is a native of the Mediterranean coasts, and has been found by Hasselquist on Mount Tabor. The Talmud enumerates rue amongst kitchen herbs, and regards it as free of tithe as being a plant not cultivated in gardens. In our Lord\u0027s time however rue was doubtless a garden plant, and therefore tithable."}]}
