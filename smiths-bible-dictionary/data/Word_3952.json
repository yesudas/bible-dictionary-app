{"word":"Shur","sections":[{"paragraph":"(a wall), a place just without the eastern border of Egypt. Shur is first mentioned in the narrative of Haggar\u0027s flight from Sarah. (Genesis 16:7) Abraham afterward \"dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.\" (Genesis 20:1) It is also called Ethami. The wilderness of Shur was entered in the Israelites after they had crossed the Red Sea. (Exodus 15:22,23) It was also called the wilderness of Etham. (Numbers 33:8) Shur may have been a territory town east of the ancient head of the Red Sea; and from its being spoken of as a limit, it was probably the last Arabian town before entering Egypt."}]}
