{"word":"Nahor","sections":[{"paragraph":"(snorting), the name of two persons in the family of Abraham."},{"paragraph":"+ His grandfather; the son of Serug and father of Terah. (Genesis 11:22-25) (B.C. 2174.) + Grandson of the preceding son of Terah and brother of Abraham and Haran. (Genesis 11:26,27) (B.C. 2000.) The order of the ages of the family of Terah is not improbably inverted in the narrative; in which case Nahor instead of being younger than Abraham, was really older. He married Milcah, the daughter of his brother Haran; and when Abraham and Lot migrated to Canaan, Nahor remained behind in the land of his birth, on the eastern side of the Euphrates."}]}
