{"word":"Huzzab","sections":[{"paragraph":"(fixed), according to the general opinion of the Jews, was the queen of Nineveh at the time when Nahum delivered his prophecy. (Nahum 2:7) (B.C. about 700.) The moderns follow the rendering in the margin of our English Bible--\"that which was established.\" Still it is not improbable that after all Huzzab may really be a proper name. It may mean \"the Zab country,\" or the fertile tract east of the Tigris, watered by the upper and lower Zab rivers."}]}
