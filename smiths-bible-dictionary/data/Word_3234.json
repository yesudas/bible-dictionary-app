{"word":"Padanaram","sections":[{"paragraph":"By this name, which signifies the table-land of Aram, i.e. Syriac, the Hebrews designated the tract of country which they otherwise called the Aram-naharaim, \"Aram of the two of rivers,\" the Greek Mesopotamia, (Genesis 24:10) and \"the field (Authorized Version,\u0027country\u0027) of Syria.\" (Hosea 12:13) The term was perhaps more especially applied to that portion which bordered on the Euphrates, to distinguish if from the mountainous districts in the north and northeast of Mesopotamia. It is elsewhere called [936]Padan simply. (Genesis 48:7) Abraham obtained a wife for Isaac from Padan-aram. (Genesis 25:20) Jacob\u0027s wives were also from Padan-aram, (Genesis 28:2,5,6,7; 31:1-8; 33:18)"}]}
