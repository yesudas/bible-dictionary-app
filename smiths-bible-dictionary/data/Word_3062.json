{"word":"Naioth","sections":[{"paragraph":"(habitations), or more fully, \"Naioth in Ramah,\" a place of Mount Ephraim, the birthplace of Samuel and Saul, and in which Samuel and David took refuge together after the latter had made his escape from the jealous fury of Saul. (1 Samuel 19:18,19,22,23; 20:1) It is evident from ver. (1 Samuel 20:18) that Naioth was not actually in Ramah, Samuel\u0027s habitual residence. In its corrected from the name signifies \"habitations,\" and probably means the huts or dwellings of a school or college of prophets over which Samuel presided as Elisha did over those at Gilgal and Jericho."}]}
