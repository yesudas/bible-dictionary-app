{"word":"Lubim","sections":[{"paragraph":"(dwellers in a thirsty land),a nation mentioned as contributing, together with Cushites and Sukkiim, to Shishak\u0027s army, (2 Chronicles 12:3) and apparently as forming with Cushites the bulk of Zerah\u0027s army, (2 Chronicles 16:8) spoken of by Nahum, (Nahum 3:9) with Put or Phut, as helping No-amon (Thebes), of which Cush and Egypt were the strength. Upon the Egyptian monuments we find representations of a people called Rebu or Lebu, who correspond to the Lubim, and who may be placed on the African coast to the westward of Egypt, perhaps extending far beyond the Cyrenaica."}]}
