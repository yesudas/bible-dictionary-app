{"word":"Spider","sections":[{"paragraph":"The Hebrew word \u0027accabish in (Job 8:24; Isaiah 59:5) is correctly rendered \"spider.\" Put semamith is wrongly translated \"spider\" in (Proverbs 30:28) it refers probably to some kind of lizard. (But \"there are many species of spider in Palestine: some which spin webs, like the common garden spider; some which dig subterranean cells and make doors in them, like the well-known trap-door spider of southern Europe; and some which have no web, but chase their prey upon the ground, like the hunting-and the wolf-spider.\"--Wood\u0027s Bible Animals.)"}]}
