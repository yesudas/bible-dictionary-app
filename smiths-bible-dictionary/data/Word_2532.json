{"word":"Kir Of Moab","sections":[{"paragraph":"(fortress of Moab), one of the two chief strongholds of Moab, the other being Ar of Moab. The name occurs only in (Isaiah 15:1) though the place is probably referred to under the names of Kir-heres, Kir-harseth, etc. It is almost identical with the name Kerak, by which the site of an important city in a high and very strong position at the southeast of the Dead Sea is known at this day. Its situation is truly remarkable. It is built upon the top of a steep hill, surrounded by a deep and narrow valley, which again is completely enclosed by mountains rising higher than the town and overlooking it on all sides."}]}
