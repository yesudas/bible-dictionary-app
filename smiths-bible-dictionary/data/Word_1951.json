{"word":"Hills","sections":[{"paragraph":"From the Hebrew Gibeah, meaning a curved round hill. But our translators have also employed the same English word for the very different term har, which has a much more extended sense than gibeah, meaning a whole district. For instance, in (Exodus 24:4) the \"hill\" is the same which is elsewhere in the same chapter, vs. (Exodus 24:12,13,18) etc., and book consistently and accurately rendered \"mount\" and \"mountain.\" The \"country of the hills,\" in (1:7; Joshua 9:1; 10:40; 11:16) is the elevated district of Judah, Benjamin and Ephraim, which is correctly called \"the mountain\" in the earliest descriptions of Palestine, (Numbers 13:29) and in many subsequent passages."}]}
