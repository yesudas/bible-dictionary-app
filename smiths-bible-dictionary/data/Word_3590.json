{"word":"Ring","sections":[{"paragraph":"The ring was regarded as an indispensable article of a Hebrew\u0027s attire, inasmuch as it contained his signet. It was hence the symbol of authority. (Genesis 41:42; Esther 3:10) Rings were worn not only by men, but by women. (Isaiah 3:21) We may conclude from (Exodus 28:11) that the rings contained a stone engraven with a device or with the owner\u0027s name. The custom appears also to have prevailed among the Jews of the apostolic age. (James 2:2)"}]}
