{"word":"Palsy","sections":[{"paragraph":"(contracted from paralysis). The loss of sensation or the power of motion, or both, in any part of the body. The infirmities included under this name in the New Testament were various:--"},{"paragraph":"+ The paralytic shock affecting the whole body, or apoplexy. + That affecting only one side. + Affecting the whole system below the neck. + Catalepsy, caused by the contraction of the muscles in the whole or a part of the body. This was very dangerous and often fatal. The part affected remains immovable and diminishes in size and dries up. A hand thus affected was called \"a withered hand.\" (Matthew 12:10-13) + Cramp. This was a most dreadful disease caused by the chills of the nights. The limbs remain immovably fixed in the same position as when seized as it, and the person seems like one suffering torture. It is frequently followed in a few days by death. Several paralytics were cured by Jesus. (Matthew 4:24; 8:13) etc."}]}
