{"word":"Hiddekel","sections":[{"paragraph":"(rapid), one of the rivers of Eden, the river which \"goeth eastward to Assyria,\" (Genesis 2:14) and which Daniel calls \"the great river,\" (Daniel 10:4) seems to have been rightly identified by the LXX. with the Tigris. Dekel is clearly an equivalent of Digla or Dighath, a name borne by the Tigris in all ages. The name now in use among the inhabitants of Mesopotamia is Dijleh ."}]}
