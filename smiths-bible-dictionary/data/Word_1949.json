(2 Kings 22:4) seq. 2Chr 34:9 Seq.; 1 Esd. 1:8. (B.C. 623.) His high priesthood was rendered particularly illustrious by the great reformation effected under it by King Josiah, by the solemn Passover kept at Jerusalem in the 18th year of that king\u0027s reign, and above all by the discovery which he made of the book of the law of Moses in the temple. + A Merarite Levite, son of Amzi (1 Chronicles 6:45) hebr. 30. + Another Merarite Levite, second son of Hosah. (1 Chronicles 26:11) + One of those who stood on the right hand of Ezra when he read the law to the people; doubtless a Levite, and probably a priest.
