{"word":"Rhegium","sections":[{"paragraph":"(breach), an Italian town situated on the Bruttian coast, just at the southern entrance of the Straits of Messina. The name occurs in the account of St. Paul\u0027s voyage from Syracuse to Puteoli, after the shipwreck at Malta. (Acts 28:13) By a curious coincidence, the figures on its coin are the very \"twin brothers\" which gave the name to St. Paul\u0027s ship. It was originally a Greek colony; it was miserably destroyed by Dionysius of Syracuse. From Augustus it received advantages which combined with its geographical position in making it important throughout the duration of the Roman empire. The modern Reggio is a town of 10,000 inhabitants. Its distance across the straits from Messina is only about six miles."}]}
