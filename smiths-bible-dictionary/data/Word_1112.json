Only one son is attributed to him, (Genesis 46:23) but his tribe was, with the exception of Judah, the most numerous of all.

(Joshua 19:48) But notwithstanding its smallness it had eminent natural advantages. On the north and east it was completely embraced by its two brother tribes Ephraim and Benjamin, while on the southeast and south it joined Judah, and was thus surrounded by the three most powerful states of the whole confederacy. It was a rich and fertile district; but the Amorites soon \"forced them into the mountain,\" (Judges 1:34) and they had another portion granted them. Judges 18.

It is now Tell el-Kadi, a mound, three miles from Banias, from the foot of which gushes out one of the largest fountains in the world, the main source of the Jordan."}]}
