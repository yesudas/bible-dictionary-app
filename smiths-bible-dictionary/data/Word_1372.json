{"word":"Ensign","sections":[{"paragraph":"(nes ; in the Authorized Version generally \"ensign,\" sometimes \"standard;\" degel, \"standard,\" with the exception of (Song of Solomon 2:4) \"banner;\" oth, \"ensign\"). This distinction between these three Hebrew terms is sufficiently marked by their respective uses. Nes is a signal, and not a military standard. It is an occasional signal, which was exhibited on the top of a pole from a bare mountain-top, (Isaiah 13:2; 18:3) degel a military standard for a large division of an army; and oth the same for a small one. Neither of them, however, expresses the idea which \"standard\" conveys to our minds, viz. a flag. The standards in use among the Hebrews probably resembled those of the Egyptians and Assyrians--a figure or device of some kind elevated on a pole; usually a sacred emblem, such as an animal, a boat, or the king\u0027s name."}]}
