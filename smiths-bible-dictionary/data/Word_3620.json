{"word":"Rye","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Heb. cussemeth) occurs in (Exodus 9:32; Isaiah 28:25) in the latter the margin reads \"spelt.\" In (Ezekiel 4:9) the text has \"fitches\" and the margin \"rie.\" It is probable that by cussemeth \"spelt\" is intended. Spelt (Triticum spelta) is grown in some parts of the south of Germany; it differs but slightly from our common wheat (T. vulgare)."}]}
