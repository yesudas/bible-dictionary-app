It was situated on the east side of the Pelusiac branch of the Nile, just below the point of the Delta, and about twenty miles northeast of Memphis.

Heliopolis was anciently famous for its learning, and Eudoxus and Plato studied under its priests.

The two famous obelisks, long called \"Cleopatra\u0027s Needles,\" one of which now stands in London and the other in Central Park in New York city, once stood before this city, and were seen by the children of Israel before the exodus, having been quarried at Syene on the Nile, erected at On (Heliopolis) by Thothmes III., B.C. 1500, and inscriptions added by Rameses II.
