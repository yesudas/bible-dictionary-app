{"word":"Judaea, Or Judea","sections":[{"paragraph":"(from Judah), a territorial division which succeeded to the overthrow of the ancient landmarks of the tribes of Israel and Judah in their respective captivities. The word first occurs (Daniel 5:13) Authorized Version \"Jewry,\" and the first mention of the \"province of Judea\" is in the book of Ezra, (Ezra 5:8) It is alluded to in (Nehemiah 11:3) (Authorized Version \"Judah\"). In the apocryphal books the word \"province\" is dropped, and throughout them and the New Testament the expressions are \"the land of Judea,\" \"Judea.\" In a wide and more improper sense, the term Judea was sometimes extended to the whole country of the Canaanites, its ancient inhabitants; and even in the Gospels we read of the coasts of Judea \"beyond Jordan.\" (Matthew 19:1; Mark 10:1) Judea was, in strict language, the name of the third district, west of the Jordan and south of Samaria. It was made a portion of the Roman province of Syria upon the deposition of Archelaus, the ethnarch of Judea, in A.D. 6, and was governed by a procurator, who was subject to the governor of Syria."}]}
