{"word":"Sop","sections":[{"paragraph":"In eastern lands where our table utensils are unknown, the meat, with the broth, is brought upon the table in a large dish, and is eaten usually by means of pieces of bread clipped into the common dish. The bread so dipped is called. \"It was such a piece of bread a sop dipped in broth that Jesus gave to Judas, (John 13:26) and again, in Matt 26:23 It is said \"he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish,\" i.e. to make a sop by dipping a piece of bread into the central dish."}]}
