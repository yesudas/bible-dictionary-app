{"word":"Judgment Hall","sections":[{"paragraph":"The word praetorium is so translated five times in the Authorized Version of the New Testament, and in those five passages it denotes two different places."},{"paragraph":"+ In (John 18:28,33; 19:9) it is the residence which Pilate occupied when he visited Jerusalem. The site of Pilate\u0027s praetorium in Jerusalem has given rise to much dispute, some supposing it to be the palace of King Herod, others the tower of Antonia; but it was probably the latter, which was then and long afterward the citadel of Jerusalem. + In (Acts 23:35) Herod\u0027s judgment hall or praetorium in Caesarea was doubtless a part of that magnificent range of buildings the erection of which by King Herod is described in Josephus. The word \"palace,\" or \"Caesar\u0027s court.\" in the Authorized Version of (Philemon 1:13) is a translation of the same word praetorium. It may here have denoted the quarter of that detachment of the praetorian guards which was in immediate attendance upon the emperor, and had barracks in Mount Palatine at Rome."}]}
