{"word":"Golgotha","sections":[{"paragraph":"(skull), the Hebrew name of the spot at which our Lord was crucified. (Matthew 27:33; Mark 15:22; John 19:17) By these three evangelists it is interpreted to mean the \"place of a skull.\" Two explanations of the name are given: (1) that it was a spot where executions ordinarily took place, and therefore abounded in skulls; or(2) it may come from the look or form of the spot itself, bald, round and skull-like, and therefore a mound or hillock, in accordance with the common phrase--for which there is no direct authority-- \"Mount Calvary.\" Whichever of these is the correct explanation, Golgotha seems to have been a known spot."}]}
