{"word":"Zabad","sections":[{"paragraph":"(gift)."},{"paragraph":"+ Son of Nathan son of Attai, son of Ahlai Sheshan\u0027s daughter, (1 Chronicles 2:31-37) and hence called son of Ahlai. (1 Chronicles 11:41) (B.C. 1046.) He was one of David\u0027s mighty men but none of his deeds have been recorded. The chief interest connected with him is in his genealogy, which is of considerable importance in a chronological point of view. + An Ephraimite, if the text of (1 Chronicles 7:21) Isa correct. + Son of Shimeath, an Ammonitess; an assassin who, with Jehozabad, slew King Joash, according to (2 Chronicles 24:26) (B.C. 840); but in (2 Kings 12:21) his name is written, probably more correctly, [1310]Jozachar. + A layman of Israel, of the sons of Zattu, who put away his foreign wife at Ezra\u0027s command. (Ezra 10:27) (B.C. 458.) + One of the descendants of Hashum who had married a foreign wife after the captivity. (Ezra 10:33) (B.C. 458.) + One of the sons of Nebo whose name is mentioned under the same circumstances as the two preceding. (Ezra 10:43)"}]}
