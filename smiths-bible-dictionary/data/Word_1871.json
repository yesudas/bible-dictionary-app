{"word":"Heaven","sections":[{"paragraph":"There are four Hebrew words thus rendered in the Old Testament which we may briefly notice."},{"paragraph":"+ Raki\u0027a, Authorized Version, firmament. [[602]Firmament] + Shamayim . This is the word used in the expression \"the heaven and the earth,\" or \"the upper and lower regions.\" (Genesis 1:1) + Marom, used for heaven in (Psalms 18:16; Isaiah 24:18; Jeremiah 25:30). Properly speaking it means a mountain as in (Psalms 102:19; Ezekiel 17:23) + Shechakim, \"expanses,\" with reference to the extent of heaven. (33:26; Job 35:5) St. Paul\u0027s expression \"third heaven,\" (2 Corinthians 12:2) had led to much conjecture. Grotius said that the Jews divided the heaven into three parts, viz., + The air or atmosphere, where clouds gather; + The firmament, in which the sun, moon and stars are fixed; + The upper heaven, the abode of God and his angels, the invisible realm of holiness and happiness the home of the children of God."}]}
