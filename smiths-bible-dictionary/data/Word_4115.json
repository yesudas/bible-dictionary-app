{"word":"Tachmonite, The","sections":[{"paragraph":"\"The Tachmonite that sat in the seat,\" chief among David\u0027s captains, (2 Samuel 23:8) Isa in 1Chr 11:11 Called \"Jashobeam an Hachmonite,\" or, as the margin gives it, \"son of Hachmoni.\" Kennicott has shown that the words translated \"he that sat in the seat\" are a corruption of Jashobeam, and that \"the Tachmonite\" is a corruption of the \"son of Hachmoni,\" which was the family or local name of Jashobeam. Therefore he concludes \"Jashobeam the Hachmonite\" to have been the true reading."}]}
