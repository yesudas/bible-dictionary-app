{"word":"Burnt Offering","sections":[{"paragraph":"The word is applied to the offering which was wholly consumed by fire on the altar, and the whole of which, except the refuse ashes \"ascended\" in the smoke to God. The meaning of the whole burnt offering was that which is the original idea of all sacrifice, the offering by the sacrificer of himself, soul and body, to God--the submission of his will to the will of the Lord. The ceremonies of the burnt offering are given in detail in the book of Leviticus. [[326]Sacrifice]"}]}
