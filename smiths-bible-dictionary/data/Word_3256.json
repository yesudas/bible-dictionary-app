{"word":"Paradise","sections":[{"paragraph":"This is a word of Persian origin, and is used in the Septuagint as the translation of Eden. It means \"an orchard of pleasure and fruits,\" a \"garden\" or \"pleasure ground,\" something like an English park. It is applied figuratively to the celestial dwelling of the righteous, in allusion to the garden of Eden. (2 Corinthians 12:4; Revelation 2:7) It has thus come into familiar use to denote both that garden and the heaven of the just."}]}
