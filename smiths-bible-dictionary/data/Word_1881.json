{"word":"Heifer","sections":[{"paragraph":"(1 Samuel 6:7-12; Job 21:10; Isaiah 7:21) The heifer or young cow was not commonly used for ploughing, but only for treading out the corn. (Hosea 10:11) but see Judg 14:18 When it ran about without any headstall, (26:4) hence the expression an \"unbroken heifer,\" (Hosea 4:16) Authorized Version \"backsliding\" to which Israel is compared."}]}
