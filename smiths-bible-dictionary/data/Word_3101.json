{"word":"Neiel","sections":[{"paragraph":"(moved by God), a place which formed one of the landmarks of the boundary of the tribe of Asher. (Joshua 19:27) only. It occurs between Jiphthahel and Cabul. If the former of these be identified with Jefat, and the latter with Kabul, eight or nine miles east-southeast of Akka, then Neiel may possibly be represented by Mi\u0027ar, a village conspicuously placed on a lofty mountain brow, just halfway between the two."}]}
