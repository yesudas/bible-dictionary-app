{"word":"Peniel","sections":[{"paragraph":"(face of God) the name which Jacob gave to the place in which he had wrestled with God: \"He called the name of the place \u0027face of El,\u0027 for I have seen Elohim face to face.\" (Genesis 32:30) In (Genesis 32:31) and the other passages in which the name occurs, its form is changed to [948]Penuel. From the narrative it is evident that Peniel lay somewhere on the north bank of the Jabbok, and between that torrent and the fords of the Jordan at Succoth, a few miles north of the glen where the Jabbok falls into the Jordan."}]}
