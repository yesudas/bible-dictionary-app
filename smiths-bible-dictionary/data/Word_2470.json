{"word":"Jude, Or Judas","sections":[{"paragraph":"called also LEBBEUS and [770]Thaddeus, Authorized Version \"Judas the brother of James,\" one of the twelve apostles. The name of Jude occurs only once in the Gospel narrative. (John 14:22; Matthew 10:3; Mark 3:18; Luke 6:16; John 14:22; Acts 1:13) Nothing is certainly known of the later history of the apostle. Tradition connects him with the foundation of the church at Edessa."}]}
