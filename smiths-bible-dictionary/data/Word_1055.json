{"word":"Corn","sections":[{"paragraph":"The most common kinds were wheat, barley, spelt, Authorized Version, (Exodus 9:32) and Isai 28:25 \"Rye;\" (Ezekiel 4:9) \"fitches\" and millet; oats are mentioned only by rabbinical writers. Our Indian corn was unknown in Bible times. Corn-crops are still reckoned at twentyfold what was sown, and were anciently much more. (Genesis 41:22) The Jewish law permitted any one in passing through a filed of standing corn to pluck and eat. (23:25) see also Matt 12:1 From Solomon\u0027s time, (2 Chronicles 2:10,15) as agriculture became developed under a settled government, Palestine was a corn-exporting country, and her grain was largely taken by her commercial neighbor Tyre.
