{"word":"Ethbaal","sections":[{"paragraph":"(with Baal), king of Sidon and father of Jezebel. (1 Kings 16:31) Josephus represents him as a king of the Tyrians as well as of the Sidonians. We may thus identify him with Eithobalus, who, after having assassinated Pheles, usurped the throne of Tyre for thirty-two years. The date of Ethbaal\u0027s reign may be given as about B.C. 940-908."}]}
