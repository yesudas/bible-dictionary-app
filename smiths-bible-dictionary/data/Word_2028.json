The name is plural, as if of a tribe rather than an individual. In (Numbers 26:42) the name is changed to Shuham. + A Benjamite, (1 Chronicles 7:12) and here again apparently the plural nature of the name is recognized, and Hushim are stated to be \"the sons of Aher.\" + One of the two wives of Shaharaim.
