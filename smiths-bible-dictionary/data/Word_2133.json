{"word":"Ittai","sections":[{"paragraph":"(with the Lord)."},{"paragraph":"+ \"Ittai the Gittite,\" i.e. the native of Gath, a Philistine in the army of King David. He appears only during the revolution of Absalom. (B.C. 1023.) We first discern him on the morning of David\u0027s flight. The king urges him to return. (2 Samuel 15:18,19) Comp. 1Sam 23:13; 27:2; 30:9,10,19,20 But ittai is firm; he is the king\u0027s slave, and wherever his master goes he will go. Accordingly he is allowed by David to proceed. When the army was numbered and organized by David at Mahanaim, Ittai again appears, now in command of a third part of the force. (2 Samuel 18:2,5,12) + Son of Ribai, from Gibeah of Benjamin; one of the thirty heroes of David\u0027s guard. (2 Samuel 23:29)"}]}
