{"word":"Rubies","sections":[{"paragraph":"Concerning the meaning of the Hebrew words translated \"rubies\" there is much difference of opinion. (Job 28:18) see also Prov 3:15; 8:11; 31:10 Some suppose \"coral\" to be in tended; others \"pearl,\" supposing that the original word signifies merely \"bright in color,\" or \"color of a reddish tinge.\" (The real ruby is a red sapphire, next in value to the diamond. The finest rubies are brought chiefly from Ceylon and Burmah.)"}]}
