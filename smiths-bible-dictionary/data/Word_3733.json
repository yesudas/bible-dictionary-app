It is written after the enumeration of the sons of Joktan, \"And their dwelling was from Mesha as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.\" (Genesis 10:30) The Joktanites occupied the southwestern portion of the peninsula of Arabia. The undoubted identifications of Arabian places and tribes with their Joktanite originals are included within these limits, and point to Sephar, on the shore of the Indian Ocean, as the eastern boundary. The ancient seaport town called Zafar represents the biblical site or district."}]}
