{"word":"Frog","sections":[{"paragraph":"a well-known amphibious animal of the genus Rana . The mention of this reptile in the Old Testament is confined to the passage in (Exodus 8:2-7) etc., in which the plague of frogs is described, and to (Psalms 78:45; 105:30) In the New Testament the word occurs once only, in (Revelation 16:13) There is no question as to the animal meant. The only known species of frog which occurs at present in Egypt is the Rana esculenta, the edible frog of the continent."}]}
