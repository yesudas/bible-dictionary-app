The latter prophet mentions it as a boundary-town, evidently on the eastern border. (Ezekiel 29:10; 30:6) In the prophecy of Jeremiah the Jews in Egypt are spoken of as dwelling at Migdol. (Jeremiah 44:1) It seems plain, from its being spoken of with Memphis, and from Jews dwelling there, that this Midgol was an important town."}]}
