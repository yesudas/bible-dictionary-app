{"word":"Magog","sections":[{"paragraph":"(region of Gog). In (Genesis 10:2) Magog appears as the second son of Japheth; in (Ezekiel 38:2; 39:1,6) it appears as a country or people of which Gog was the prince. The notices of Magog would lead us to fix a northern locality: it is expressly stated by Ezekiel that \"he was to come up from the sides of the north,\" (Ezekiel 39:2) from a country adjacent to that of Togarmah or Armenia, ch. 58:6 and not far from \"the isles\" or maritime regions of Europe. ch. (Ezekiel 39:6) The people of Magog further appear as having a force of cavalry, (Ezekiel 38:16) and as armed with the bow. ch. (Ezekiel 39:3) From the above data, may conclude that Magog represents the important race of the Scythians."}]}
