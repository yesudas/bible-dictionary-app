{"word":"Adonijah","sections":[{"paragraph":"(my Lord is Jehovah)."},{"paragraph":"+ The fourth son of David by Haggith, born at Hebron while his father was king of Judah. (2 Samuel 3:4) (B.C. about 1050.) After the death of his three brothers, Amnon, Chileab and Absalom, he became eldest son; and when his father\u0027s strength was visibly declining, put forward his pretensions to the crown. Adonijah\u0027s cause was espoused by Abiathar and by Joab the famous commander of David\u0027s army. [[58]Joab] His name and influence secured a large number of followers among the captains of the royal army belonging to the tribe of Judah, comp. (1 Kings 1:5) and these, together with all the princes except Solomon, were entertained by Adonijah at the great sacrificial feast held \"by the stone Zoheleth, which is by En-rogel.\" [EN-ROGEL] Apprised of these proceedings, David immediately caused Solomon to be proclaimed king, (1 Kings 1:33,34) at Gihon. [[59]Gihon] This decisive measure struck terror into the opposite party, and Adonijah fled to the sanctuary, but was pardoned by Solomon on condition that he should \"show himself a worthy man.\" (1 Kings 1:52) The death of David quickly followed on these events; and Adonijah begged Bath-sheba to procure Solomon\u0027s consent to his marriage with Abishag, who had been the wife of David in his old age. (1 Kings 1:3) This was regarded as equivalent to a fresh attempt on the throne [[60]Absalom; [61]Abner]; and therefore Solomon ordered him to be put to death by Benaiah. (1 Kings 2:25) + A Levite in the reign of Jehoshaphat. (2 Chronicles 17:8) + The same as Adonikam. (Nehemiah 10:16) [[62]Adonikam, Or Adonikam]"}]}
