{"word":"Syracuse","sections":[{"paragraph":"the celebrated city on the eastern coast of Sicily. \"The city in its splendor was the largest and richest that the Greeks possessed in any part of the world, being 22 miles in circumference.\" St. Paul arrived thither in an Alexandrian ship from Melita, on his voyage to Rome. (Acts 28:12) The site of Syracuse rendered it a convenient place for the African corn-ships to touch at, for the harbor was an excellent one, and the fountain Arethusa in the island furnished an unfailing supply of excellent water."}]}
