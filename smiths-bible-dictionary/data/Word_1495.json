(Exodus 27:3; 38:3; 2 Kings 25:15; Jeremiah 52:19) The same word is elsewhere rendered \"snuff-dish,\" (Exodus 25:38; 37:23; Numbers 4:9) and \"censer.\" (Leviticus 10:1; 16:12; Numbers 16:6) ff. There appear, therefore, to have been two articles so called: one, like a chafing-dish, to carry live coals for the purpose of burning incense; another, like a snuffer-dish, to be used in trimming the lamps, in order to carry the snuffers and convey away the snuff."}]}
