{"word":"Forehead","sections":[{"paragraph":"The practice of veiling the face (forehead) in public for women of the high classes, especially married women, in the East, sufficiently stigmatizes with reproach the unveiled face of women of bad character. (Genesis 24:64; Jeremiah 3:3) The custom among many Oriental nations both of coloring the face and forehead and of impressing on the body marks indicative of devotion to some special deity or religious sect is mentioned elsewhere. The \"jewels for the forehead,\" mentioned by Ezekiel, (Ezekiel 16:12) and in margin of Authorized Version, (Genesis 24:22) were in all probability nose-rings. (Isaiah 3:21)"}]}
