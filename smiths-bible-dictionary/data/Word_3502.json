{"word":"Rachel","sections":[{"paragraph":"(ewe, or sheep), the younger of the daughters of Laban, the wife of Jacob (B.C. 1753) and mother of Joseph and Benjamin. The incidents of her life may be found in Genesis29-33, 35. The story of Jacob and Rachel has always had a peculiar interest. The beauty of Rachel, Jacob\u0027s deep love and long servitude for her, their marriage, and Rachel\u0027s death on giving birth to Benjamin, with Jacob\u0027s grief at her loss, (Genesis 48:7) makes a touching tale. Yet from what is related to us concerning her character there does not seem much to claim any high degree of admiration and esteem. She appears to have shared all the duplicity and falsehood of her family. See, for instance, Rachel\u0027s stealing her father\u0027s images, and the ready dexterity and presence of mind with which she concealed her theft. (Genesis 31:1) ... \"Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem. (B.C. 1729.) And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave; that is the pillar of Rachel\u0027s grave unto this day.\" (Genesis 35:19,20) The site of Rachel\u0027s tomb, \"on the way to Bethlehem,\" \"a little way to come to Ephrath,\" \"in the border of Benjamin,\" never been questioned. It Is about two miles south of Jerusalem and one mile north of Bethlehem."}]}
