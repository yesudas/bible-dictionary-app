{"word":"Ishbosheth","sections":[{"paragraph":"(man of shame) the youngest of Saul\u0027s four sons, and his legitimate successor. (B.C. 1068.) Ish-bosheth was \"forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years.\" (2 Samuel 3:10) During these two years he reigned at Mahanaim, though only in name. The wars and negotiations with David were entirely carried on by Abner (2 Samuel 2:12; 3:6,12) The death of Abner deprived the house of Saul of its last remaining support. When Ish-bosheth heard of it, \"his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.\" He was murdered in his bed."}]}
