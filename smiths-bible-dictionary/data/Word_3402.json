{"word":"Pitcher","sections":[{"paragraph":"This word is used in the Authorized Version to denote the earthen water-jars or pitchers with one or two handles, used chiefly by women for carrying water, as in the story of Rebekah. (Genesis 24:15-20) but see Mark 14:13; Luke 22:10 This mode of carrying has been and still is customary the East and elsewhere. The vessels used for the purpose are generally borne on the head or the shoulder. The Bedouin women commonly use skin bottles. Such was the \"bottle\" carried by Hagar (Genesis 21:14) The same word is used of the pitchers employed by Gideon\u0027s three hundred men. (Judges 7:16)"}]}
