The ruins of this ancient city, still bearing the name Edr\u0027a, stand on a rocky promontory which projects from the southwest corner of the Lejah. The ruins are nearly three miles in circumference, and have a strange, wild, look, rising up in dark, shattered masses from the midst of a wilderness of black rocks. + A town of northern Palestine, allotted to the tribe of Naphtali, and situated near Kedesh.
