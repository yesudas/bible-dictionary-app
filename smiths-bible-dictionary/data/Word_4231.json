{"word":"Timnathserah","sections":[{"paragraph":"(portion of abundance), the name of the city which was presented to Joshua after the partition of the country, (Joshua 19:50) and in \"the border\" of which he was buried. (Joshua 24:30) It is specified as \"in Mount Ephraim on the north side of Mount Gaash.\" In (Judges 2:9) the name is altered to TIMNATH-HERES. The latter form is that adopted by the Jewish writers. Accordingly, they identify the place with Kefar-cheres, which is said by Jewish travellers to be about five miles south of Shechem (Nablus). No place with that name appears on the maps. Another identification has, however been suggested by Dr. Eli Smith. In his journey from Jifna to Mejdel-Yaba, about six miles from the former he discovered the ruins of a considerable town. Opposite the town was a much higher hill, in the north side of which are several excavated sepulchres. The whole bears the name of Tibneh ."}]}
