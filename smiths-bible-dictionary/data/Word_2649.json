(Judges 18:7,14,27,29) [[814]Dan] It was near the sources of the Jordan. In the Authorized Version Laish is again mentioned in the account of Sennacherib\u0027s march on Jerusalem. (Isaiah 10:30) This Laish is probably the small village Laishah, lying between Gallim and Anathoth in Benjamin, and of which hitherto no traces have been found. (Fairbairn\u0027s \"Imperial Bible Dictionary\" suggests that it may be the present little village el-Isawiyeh, in a beautiful valley a mile northeast of Jerusalem.--ED.)"}]}
