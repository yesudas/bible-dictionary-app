{"word":"Lords Day, The","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Kuriake Hemera), (Revelation 1:10) (only), the weekly festival of our Lord\u0027s resurrection, and identified with \"the first day of the week,\" or \"Sunday,\" of every age of the Church. Scripture says very little concerning this day; but that little seems to indicate that the divinely-inspired apostles, by their practice and by their precepts, marked the first day of the week as a day for meeting together to break bread, for communicating and receiving instruction, for laying up offerings in store for charitable purposes, for occupation in holy thought and prayer. [See [820]Sabbath]"}]}
