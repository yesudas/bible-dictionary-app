{"word":"Dibon","sections":[{"paragraph":"(wasting)."},{"paragraph":"+ A town on the east side of Jordan, in the rich pastoral country, which was taken possession of and rebuilt by the children of Gad. (Numbers 32:3,34) From this circumstance it possibly received the name of DIBON-GAD. (Numbers 33:45,46) Its first mention is in (Numbers 21:30) and from this it appears to have belonged originally to the Moabites. We find Dibon counted to Reuben in the lists of Joshua. (Joshua 13:9,17) In the time of Isaiah and Jeremiah, however, it was again in possession of Moab. (Isaiah 15:2; Jeremiah 48:18,22) comp. Jere 48:24 In modern times the name Dhiban has been discovered as attached to extensive ruins on the Roman road, about three miles north of the Arnon (Wady Modjeb). + One of the towns which were reinhabited by the men of Judah after the return from captivity, (Nehemiah 11:25) identical with [435]Dimonah."}]}
