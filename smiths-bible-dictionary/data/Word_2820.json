{"word":"Mauzzim","sections":[{"paragraph":"(fortresses). The marginal note to the Authorized Version of (Daniel 11:38) \"the god of forces,\" gives as the equivalent of the last word \"Mauzzim, or gods protectors, or munitions.\" There can be little doubt that mauzzim is to be taken in its literal sense of \"fortresses,\" just as in (Daniel 11:19,39) \"the god of fortresses\" being then the deity who presided over strongholds. The opinion of Gesenius is that \"the god of fortresses\" was Jupiter Capitolinus, for whom Antiochus built a temple at Antioch. Liv. xli. 20."}]}
