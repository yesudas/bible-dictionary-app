{"word":"Swallow","sections":[{"paragraph":"Heb. deror in (Psalms 84:3; Proverbs 26:2) Heb. \u0027agur in (Isaiah 38:14; Jeremiah 8:7) but \"crane\" is more probably the true signification of \u0027agur [[1175]Crane]). The rendering of the Authorized Version for deror seems correct. The characters ascribed in the passages where the names occur are strictly applicable to the swallow, viz., its swiftness of flight, its meeting in the buildings of the temple, its mournful, garrulous note, and its regular migrations, shared indeed in common with several others. Many species of swallow occur in Palestine. All those common in England are found."}]}
