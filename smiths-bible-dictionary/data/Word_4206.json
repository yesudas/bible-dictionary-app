{"word":"Throne","sections":[{"paragraph":"The Hebrew word so translated applies to any elevated seat occupied by a person in authority, whether a high priest, (1 Samuel 1:9) a judge, (Psalms 122:5) or a military chief (Jeremiah 1:16) The use of a chair in a country where the usual postures were squatting and reclining was at all times regarded as a symbol of dignity. (2 Kings 4:10; Proverbs 9:14) In order to specify a throne in our sense of the term, it was necessary to add to the word the notion of royalty; hence the frequent occurrence of such expressions as \"throne of the kingdom.\" (17:18; 1 Kings 1:46; 2 Chronicles 7:18) The characteristic feature in the royal throne was its elevation: Solomon\u0027s throne was approached by six steps, (1 Kings 10:19; 2 Chronicles 9:18) and Jehovah\u0027s throne is described as \"high and lifted up.\" (Isaiah 6:1) The materials and workmanship of Solomon\u0027s throne were costly. It was made of wood inlaid with ivory and then covered with gold except where the ivory showed. It was furnished with arms or \"stays.\" The steps were also lines with pairs of lions. As to the form of chair, we are only informed in (1 Kings 10:19) that \"the top was round behind.\" The king sat on his throne on state occasions. At such times he appeared in his royal robes. The throne was the symbol of supreme power and dignity. (Genesis 41:40) Similarly, \"to sit upon the throne\" implied the exercise of regal power. (17:18; 1 Kings 16:11)"}]}
