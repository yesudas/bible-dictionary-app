{"word":"Oreb, The Rock","sections":[{"paragraph":"the \"raven\u0027s crag,\" the spot, east of Jordan, at which the Midianite chieftain Oreb with thousands of his countrymen, fell by the hand of the Ephraimites, and which probably acquired its name therefrom. It is mentioned in (Judges 7:25; Isaiah 10:26) Perhaps the place called \u0027Orbo which in the Bereshith Rabba is stated to have been in the neighborhood of Bethshean, may have some connection with it."}]}
