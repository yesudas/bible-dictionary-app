{"word":"Theatre","sections":[{"paragraph":"For the explanation of the biblical allusions, two or three points only require notice. The Greek term, like the corresponding English term, denotes the place where dramatic performances are exhibited, and also the scene itself or spectacle which is witnessed there. It occurs in the first or local sense in (Acts 19:29) The other sense of the term \"theatre\" occurs in (1 Corinthians 4:9)"}]}
