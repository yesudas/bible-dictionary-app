{"word":"Nicopolis","sections":[{"paragraph":"(city of victory) is mentioned in (Titus 3:12) as the place where St. Paul was intending to pass the coming winter. Nothing is to be found in the epistle itself to determine which Nicopolis is here intended. One Nicopolis was in Thrace, near the borders of Macedonia. The subscription (which, however, is of no authority) fixes on this place, calling it the Macedonian Nicopolis. But there is little doubt that Jerome\u0027s view is correct, and that the Pauline Nicopolis was the celebrated city of Epirus. This city (the \"city of victory\") was built by Augustus in memory the battle of Actium. It was on a peninsula, to the west of the bay of Actium."}]}
