{"word":"Ariel","sections":[{"paragraph":"(lion of God)."},{"paragraph":"+ One of the \"chief men\" who under Ezra directed the caravan which he led back from Babylon to Jerusalem. (Ezra 8:16) (B.C. 459.) The word occurs also in reference to two Moabites slain by Benaiah. (2 Samuel 23:20; 1 Chronicles 11:22) Many regard the word as an epithet, \"lion-like;\" but it seems better to look upon it as a proper name, and translate \"two [sons] of Ariel.\" + A designation given by Isaiah to the city of Jerusalem. (Isaiah 29:1,2,7) We must understand by it either \"lion of God,\" as the chief city, or \"hearth of God,\" a synonym for the altar of burnt offering. On the whole it seems most probable that, as a name given to Jerusalem, Ariel means \"lion of God,\" whilst the word used by Ezekiel, (Ezekiel 43:15,16) means \"hearth of God.\""}]}
