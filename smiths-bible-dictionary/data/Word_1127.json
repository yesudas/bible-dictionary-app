{"word":"Daughter","sections":[{"paragraph":"The word is used in Scripture not only for daughter, but for granddaughter or other female descendant. (Genesis 24:48) It is used of the female inhabitants of a place or country, (Genesis 6:2; Luke 23:28) and of cities in general, (Isaiah 10:32; 23:12) but more specifically of dependent towns or hamlets, while to the principal city the correlative \"mother\" is applied. (Numbers 21:25) \"Daughters of music,\" i.e. singing birds, (Ecclesiastes 12:4) refers to the power of making and enjoying music."}]}
