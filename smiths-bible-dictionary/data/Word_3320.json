{"word":"Perizzite, The","sections":[{"paragraph":"and Per\u0027izzites (belonging to a village), one of the nations inhabiting the land of promise before and at the time of its conquest by Israel. (B.C. 1450.) They are continually mentioned in the formula so frequently occurring to express the promised land. (Genesis 15:20; Exodus 3:8,17; 23:23; 33:2; 34:11) The notice in the book of Judges locates them in the southern part of the holy land. The signification of the name is not by any means clear. It possibly meant rustics, dwellers in open, unwalled villages, which are denoted by a similar word."}]}
