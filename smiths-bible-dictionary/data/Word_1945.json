{"word":"Higgaion","sections":[{"paragraph":"(meditation), a word which occurs three times in the book of Psalms-- (Psalms 9:16; 19:14; 92:3) (margin). The word has two meanings, one of a general character, implying thought; reflection, and another, in (Psalms 9:16) and Psal 92:3 Of a technical nature, the precise meaning of which cannot at this distance of time be determined. (Canon Cook says that it probably means an interlude giving musical expression to the feelings suggested by the preceding words.--ED.)"}]}
