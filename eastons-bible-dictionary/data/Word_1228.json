{"word":"Ephraim","sections":[{"paragraph":"Double fruitfulness (\"for God had made him fruitful in the land of his affliction\"). The second son of Joseph, born in Egypt (Gen. 41:52; 46:20). The first incident recorded regarding him is his being placed, along with his brother Manasseh, before their grandfather, Jacob, that he might bless them (48:10; comp. 27:1). The intention of Joseph was that the right hand of the aged patriarch should be placed on the head of the elder of the two; but Jacob set Ephraim the younger before his brother, \"guiding his hands wittingly.\" Before Joseph\u0027s death, Ephraim\u0027s family had reached the third generation (Gen. 50:23)."}]}
