{"word":"Intercession of Christ","sections":[{"paragraph":"Christ\u0027s priestly office consists of these two parts, (1) the offering up of himself as a sacrifice, and (2) making continual intercession for us."},{"paragraph":"When on earth he made intercession for his people (Luke 23:34; John 17:20; Heb. 5:7); but now he exercises this function of his priesthood in heaven, where he is said to appear in the presence of God for us (Heb. 9:12, 24)."},{"paragraph":"His advocacy with the Father for his people rests on the basis of his own all-perfect sacrifice. Thus he pleads for and obtains the fulfilment of all the promises of the everlasting covenant (1 John 2:1; John 17:24; Heb. 7:25). He can be \"touched with the feeling of our infirmities,\" and is both a merciful and a faithful high priest (Heb. 2:17, 18; 4:15, 16). This intercession is an essential part of his mediatorial work. Through him we have \"access\" to the Father (John 14:6; Eph. 2:18; 3:12). \"The communion of his people with the Father will ever be sustained through him as mediatorial Priest\" (Ps. 110:4; Rev. 7:17)."}]}
