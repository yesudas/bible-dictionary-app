{"word":"Fence","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Heb. gader), Num. 22:24 (R.V.). Fences were constructions of unmortared stones, to protect gardens, vineyards, sheepfolds, etc. From various causes they were apt to bulge out and fall (Ps. 62:3). In Ps. 80:12, R.V. (see Isa. 5:5), the psalmist says, \"Why hast thou broken down her fences?\" Serpents delight to lurk in the crevices of such fences (Eccl. 10:8; comp. Amos 5:19)."}]}
