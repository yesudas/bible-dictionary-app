{"word":"Cinnereth","sections":[{"paragraph":"A harp, one of the \"fenced cities\" of Naphtali (Josh. 19:35; comp. Deut. 3:17). It also denotes, apparently, a district which may have taken its name from the adjacent city or lake of Gennesaret, anciently called \"the sea of Chinnereth\" (q.v.), and was probably that enclosed district north of Tiberias afterwards called \"the plain of Gennesaret.\" Called Chinneroth (R.V., Chinnereth) Josh. 11:2. The phrase \"all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali\" in 1 Kings 15:20 is parallel to \"the store-houses of the cities of Naphtali\" (R.V. marg.) in 2 Chr. 16:4."}]}
