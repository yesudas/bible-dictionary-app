{"word":"Rock","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Heb. tsur), employed as a symbol of God in the Old Testament (1 Sam. 2:2; 2 Sam. 22:3; Isa. 17:10; Ps. 28:1; 31:2, 3; 89:26; 95:1); also in the New Testament (Matt. 16:18; Rom. 9:33; 1 Cor. 10:4). In Dan. 2:45 the Chaldaic form of the Hebrew word is translated \"mountain.\" It ought to be translated \"rock,\" as in Hab. 1:12 in the Revised Version. The \"rock\" from which the stone is cut there signifies the divine origin of Christ. (See [536]STONE.)"}]}
