{"word":"Syriac","sections":[{"paragraph":"(2 Kings 18:26; Ezra 4:7; Dan. 2:4), more correctly rendered \"Aramaic,\" including both the Syriac and the Chaldee languages. In the New Testament there are several Syriac words, such as \"Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\" (Mark 15:34; Matt. 27:46 gives the Heb. form, \"Eli, Eli\"), \"Raca\" (Matt. 5:22), \"Ephphatha\" (Mark 7:34), \"Maran-atha\" (1 Cor. 16:22)."},{"paragraph":"A Syriac version of the Old Testament, containing all the canonical books, along with some apocryphal books (called the Peshitto, i.e., simple translation, and not a paraphrase), was made early in the second century, and is therefore the first Christian translation of the Old Testament. It was made directly from the original, and not from the LXX. Version. The New Testament was also translated from Greek into Syriac about the same time. It is noticeable that this version does not contain the Second and Third Epistles of John, 2 Peter, Jude, and the Apocalypse. These were, however, translated subsequently and placed in the version. (See [614]VERSION.)"}]}
