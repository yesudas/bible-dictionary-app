{"word":"Appii Forum","sections":[{"paragraph":"I.e., \"the market of Appius\" (Acts 28:15, R.V.), a town on the road, the \"Appian Way,\" from Rome to Brundusium. It was 43 miles from Rome. Here Paul was met by some Roman Christians on his way to the capital. It was natural that they should halt here and wait for him, because from this place there were two ways by which travellers might journey to Rome."}]}
