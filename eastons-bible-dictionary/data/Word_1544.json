{"word":"Grasshopper","sections":[{"paragraph":"Belongs to the class of neuropterous insects called Gryllidae. This insect is not unknown in Palestine."},{"paragraph":"In Judg. 6:5; 7:12; Job 39:30; Jer. 46:23, where the Authorized Version has \"grasshopper,\" the Revised Version more correctly renders the Hebrew word (arbeh) by \"locust.\" This is the case also in Amos 7:1; Nah. 3:17, where the Hebrew word gob is used; and in Lev. 11:22; Num. 13:33; Eccl. 12:5; Isa. 40:22, where hagab is used. In all these instances the proper rendering is probably \"locust\" (q.v.)."}]}
