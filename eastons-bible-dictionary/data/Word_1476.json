{"word":"Gibeah","sections":[{"paragraph":"A hill or hill-town, \"of Benjamin\" (1 Sam. 13:15), better known as \"Gibeah of Saul\" (11:4; Isa. 10:29). It was here that the terrible outrage was committed on the Levite\u0027s concubine which led to the almost utter extirpation of the tribe of Benjamin (Judg. 19; 20), only six hundred men surviving after a succession of disastrous battles. This was the birthplace of Saul, and continued to be his residence after he became king (1 Sam. 10:26; 11:4; 15:34). It was reckoned among the ancient sanctuaries of Palestine (10:26; 15:34; 23:19; 26:1; 2 Sam. 21:6-10), and hence it is called \"Gibeah of God\" (1 Sam. 10:5, R.V. marg.). It has been identified with the modern Tell el-Ful (i.e., \"hill of the bean\"), about 3 miles north of Jerusalem."}]}
