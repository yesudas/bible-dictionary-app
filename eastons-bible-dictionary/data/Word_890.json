{"word":"Conversion","sections":[{"paragraph":"The turning of a sinner to God (Acts 15:3). In a general sense the heathen are said to be \"converted\" when they abandon heathenism and embrace the Christian faith; and in a more special sense men are converted when, by the influence of divine grace in their souls, their whole life is changed, old things pass away, and all things become new (Acts 26:18). Thus we speak of the conversion of the Philippian jailer (16:19-34), of Paul (9:1-22), of the Ethiopian treasurer (8:26-40), of Cornelius (10), of Lydia (16:13-15), and others. (See [125]REGENERATION.)"}]}
