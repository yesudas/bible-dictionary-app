{"word":"Tobiah","sections":[{"paragraph":"Pleasing to Jehovah, the \"servant,\" the \"Ammonite,\" who joined with those who opposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem after the Exile (Neh. 2:10). He was a man of great influence, which he exerted in opposition to the Jews, and \"sent letters\" to Nehemiah \"to put him in fear\" (Neh. 6:17-19). \"Eliashib the priest\" prepared for him during Nehemiah\u0027s absence \"a chamber in the courts of the house of God,\" which on his return grieved Nehemiah sore, and therefore he \"cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber\" (13:7, 8)."}]}
