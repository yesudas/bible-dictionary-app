{"word":"Zareth-shahar","sections":[{"paragraph":"The splendour of the dawn, a city \"in the mount of the valley\" (Josh. 13:19). It is identified with the ruins of Zara, near the mouth of the Wady Zerka Main, on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea, some 3 miles south of the Callirrhoe. Of this town but little remains. \"A few broken basaltic columns and pieces of wall about 200 yards back from the shore, and a ruined fort rather nearer the sea, about the middle of the coast line of the plain, are all that are left\" (Tristram\u0027s Land of Moab)."}]}
