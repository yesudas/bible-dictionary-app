{"word":"Covering of the eyes","sections":[{"paragraph":"Occurs only in Gen. 20:16. In the Revised Version the rendering is \"it (i.e., Abimelech\u0027s present of 1,000 pieces of silver to Abraham) is for thee a covering of the eyes.\" This has been regarded as an implied advice to Sarah to conform to the custom of married women, and wear a complete veil, covering the eyes as well as the rest of the face."}]}
