When Christ promises that he will give the \"morning star\" to his faithful ones, he \"promises that he will give to them himself, that he will give to them himself, that he will impart to them his own glory and a share in his own royal dominion; for the star is evermore the symbol of royalty (Matt. 2:2), being therefore linked with the sceptre (Num. 24:17). All the glory of the world shall end in being the glory of the Church.\" Trench\u0027s Comm."}]}
