{"word":"Magog","sections":[{"paragraph":"Region of Gog, the second of the \"sons\" of Japheth (Gen. 10:2; 1 Chr. 1:5). In Ezekiel (38:2; 39:6) it is the name of a nation, probably some Scythian or Tartar tribe descended from Japheth. They are described as skilled horsemen, and expert in the use of the bow. The Latin father Jerome says that this word denotes \"Scythian nations, fierce and innumerable, who live beyond the Caucasus and the Lake Maeotis, and near the Caspian Sea, and spread out even onward to India.\" Perhaps the name \"represents the Assyrian Mat Gugi, or country of Gugu,\u0027 the Gyges of the Greeks\" (Sayce\u0027s Races, etc.)."}]}
