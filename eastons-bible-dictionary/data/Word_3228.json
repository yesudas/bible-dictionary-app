{"word":"Satan","sections":[{"paragraph":"Adversary; accuser. When used as a proper name, the Hebrew word so rendered has the article \"the adversary\" (Job 1:6-12; 2:1-7). In the New Testament it is used as interchangeable with Diabolos, or the devil, and is so used more than thirty times."},{"paragraph":"He is also called \"the dragon,\" \"the old serpent\" (Rev. 12:9; 20:2); \"the prince of this world\" (John 12:31; 14:30); \"the prince of the power of the air\" (Eph. 2:2); \"the god of this world\" (2 Cor. 4:4); \"the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience\" (Eph. 2:2). The distinct personality of Satan and his activity among men are thus obviously recognized. He tempted our Lord in the wilderness (Matt. 4:1-11). He is \"Beelzebub, the prince of the devils\" (12:24). He is \"the constant enemy of God, of Christ, of the divine kingdom, of the followers of Christ, and of all truth; full of falsehood and all malice, and exciting and seducing to evil in every possible way.\" His power is very great in the world. He is a \"roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour\" (1 Pet. 5:8). Men are said to be \"taken captive by him\" (2 Tim. 2:26). Christians are warned against his \"devices\" (2 Cor. 2:11), and called on to \"resist\" him (James 4:7). Christ redeems his people from \"him that had the power of death, that is, the devil\" (Heb. 2:14). Satan has the \"power of death,\" not as lord, but simply as executioner."}]}
