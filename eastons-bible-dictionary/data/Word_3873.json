{"word":"Zaretan","sections":[{"paragraph":"When the Hebrews crossed the Jordan, as soon as the feet of the priests were dipped in the water, the flow of the stream was arrested. The point of arrest was the \"city of Adam beside Zaretan,\" probably near Succoth, at the mouth of the Jabbok, some 30 miles up the river from where the people were encamped. There the water \"stood and rose upon an heap.\" Thus the whole space of 30 miles of the river-bed was dry, that the tribes might pass over (Josh. 3:16, 17; comp. Ps. 104:3)."}]}
