{"word":"Bethany","sections":[{"paragraph":"House of dates. (1.) The Revised Version in John 1:28 has this word instead of Bethabara, on the authority of the oldest manuscripts. It appears to have been the name of a place on the east of Jordan."},{"paragraph":"(2.) A village on the south-eastern slope of the Mount of Olives (Mark 11:1), about 2 miles east of Jerusalem, on the road to Jericho. It derived its name from the number of palm-trees which grew there. It was the residence of Lazarus and his sisters. It is frequently mentioned in connection with memorable incidents in the life of our Lord (Matt. 21:17; 26:6; Mark 11:11, 12; 14:3; Luke 24:50; John 11:1; 12:1). It is now known by the name of el-Azariyeh, i.e., \"place of Lazarus,\" or simply Lazariyeh. Seen from a distance, the village has been described as \"remarkably beautiful, the perfection of retirement and repose, of seclusion and lovely peace.\" Now a mean village, containing about twenty families."}]}
