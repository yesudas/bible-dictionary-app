{"word":"Thunder","sections":[{"paragraph":"Often referred to in Scripture (Job 40:9; Ps. 77:18; 104:7). James and John were called by our Lord \"sons of thunder\" (Mark 3:17). In Job 39:19, instead of \"thunder,\" as in the Authorized Version, the Revised Version translates (ra\u0027amah) by \"quivering main\" (marg., \"shaking\"). Thunder accompanied the giving of the law at Sinai (Ex. 19:16). It was regarded as the voice of God (Job 37:2; Ps. 18:13; 81:7; comp. John 12:29). In answer to Samuel\u0027s prayer (1 Sam. 12:17, 18), God sent thunder, and \"all the people greatly feared,\" for at such a season (the wheat-harvest) thunder and rain were almost unknown in Palestine."}]}
