{"word":"Bat","sections":[{"paragraph":"The Hebrew word (atalleph\u0027) so rendered (Lev. 11:19; Deut. 14:18) implies \"flying in the dark.\" The bat is reckoned among the birds in the list of unclean animals. To cast idols to the \"moles and to the bats\" means to carry them into dark caverns or desolate places to which these animals resort (Isa. 2:20), i.e., to consign them to desolation or ruin."}]}
