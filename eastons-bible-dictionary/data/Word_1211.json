{"word":"Enmity","sections":[{"paragraph":"Deep-rooted hatred. \"I will put enmity between thee and the woman, between thy seed and her seed\" (Gen. 3:15). The friendship of the world is \"enmity with God\" (James 4:4; 1 John 2:15, 16). The \"carnal mind\" is \"enmity against God\" (Rom. 8:7). By the abrogation of the Mosaic institutes the \"enmity\" between Jew and Gentile is removed. They are reconciled, are \"made one\" (Eph. 2:15, 16)."}]}
