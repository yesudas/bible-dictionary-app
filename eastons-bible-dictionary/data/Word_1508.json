Shamgar slew six hundred Philistines with an ox-goad. \"The goad is a formidable weapon. It is sometimes ten feet long, and has a sharp point. We could now see that the feat of Shamgar was not so very wonderful as some have been accustomed to think.\""},{"paragraph":"In 1 Sam. 13:21, a different Hebrew word is used, dorban, meaning something pointed. The expression (Acts 9:5, omitted in the R.V.), \"It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks\", i.e., against the goad, was proverbial for unavailing resistance to superior power."}]}
