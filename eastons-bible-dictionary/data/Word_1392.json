{"word":"Fuller","sections":[{"paragraph":"The word \"full\" is from the Anglo-Saxon fullian, meaning \"to whiten.\" To full is to press or scour cloth in a mill. This art is one of great antiquity. Mention is made of \"fuller\u0027s soap\" (Mal. 3:2), and of \"the fuller\u0027s field\" (2 Kings 18:17). At his transfiguration our Lord\u0027s rainment is said to have been white \"so as no fuller on earth could white them\" (Mark 9:3). En-rogel (q.v.), meaning literally \"foot-fountain,\" has been interpreted as the \"fuller\u0027s fountain,\" because there the fullers trod the cloth with their feet."}]}
