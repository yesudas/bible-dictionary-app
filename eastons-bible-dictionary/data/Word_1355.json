Isa. 31:3; Ps. 78:39). As suggesting the idea of softness it is used in the expression \"heart of flesh\" (Ezek. 11:19). The expression \"my flesh and bone\" (Judg. 9:2; Isa. 58:7) denotes relationship."},{"paragraph":"In the New Testament, besides these it is also used to denote the sinful element of human nature as opposed to the \"Spirit\" (Rom. 6:19; Matt. 16:17). Being \"in the flesh\" means being unrenewed (Rom. 7:5; 8:8, 9), and to live \"according to the flesh\" is to live and act sinfully (Rom. 8:4, 5, 7, 12)."},{"paragraph":"This word also denotes the human nature of Christ (John 1:14, \"The Word was made flesh.\" Comp. also 1 Tim. 3:16; Rom. 1:3)."}]}
