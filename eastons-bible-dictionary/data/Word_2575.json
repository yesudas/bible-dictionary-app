{"word":"Mitre","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Heb. mitsnepheth), something rolled round the head; the turban or head-dress of the high priest (Ex. 28:4, 37, 39; 29:6, etc.). In the Authorized Version of Ezek. 21:26, this Hebrew word is rendered \"diadem,\" but in the Revised Version, \"mitre.\" It was a twisted band of fine linen, 8 yards in length, coiled into the form of a cap, and worn on official occasions (Lev. 8:9; 16:4; Zech. 3:5). On the front of it was a golden plate with the inscription, \"Holiness to the Lord.\" The mitsnepheth differed from the mitre or head-dress (migba\u0027ah) of the common priest. (See [408]BONNET.)"}]}
