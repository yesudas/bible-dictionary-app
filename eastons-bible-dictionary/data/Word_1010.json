She was bribed by the \"lords of the Philistines\" to obtain from Samson the secret of his strength and the means of overcoming it (Judg. 16:4-18). She tried on three occasions to obtain from him this secret in vain. On the fourth occasion she wrung it from him. She made him sleep upon her knees, and then called the man who was waiting to help her; who \"cut off the seven locks of his head,\" and so his \"strength went from him.\" (See [153]SAMSON.)"}]}
