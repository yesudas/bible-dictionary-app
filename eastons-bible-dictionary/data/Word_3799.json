{"word":"Weaving, weavers","sections":[{"paragraph":"Weaving was an art practised in very early times (Ex. 35:35). The Egyptians were specially skilled in it (Isa. 19:9; Ezek. 27:7), and some have regarded them as its inventors."},{"paragraph":"In the wilderness, the Hebrews practised it (Ex. 26:1, 8; 28:4, 39; Lev. 13:47). It is referred to in subsequent times as specially the women\u0027s work (2 Kings 23:7; Prov. 31:13, 24). No mention of the loom is found in Scripture, but we read of the \"shuttle\" (Job 7:6), \"the pin\" of the beam (Judg. 16:14), \"the web\" (13, 14), and \"the beam\" (1 Sam. 17:7; 2 Sam. 21:19). The rendering, \"with pining sickness,\" in Isa. 38:12 (A.V.) should be, as in the Revised Version, \"from the loom,\" or, as in the margin, \"from the thrum.\" We read also of the \"warp\" and \"woof\" (Lev. 13:48, 49, 51-53, 58, 59), but the Revised Version margin has, instead of \"warp,\" \"woven or knitted stuff.\""}]}
