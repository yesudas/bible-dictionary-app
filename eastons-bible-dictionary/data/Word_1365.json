{"word":"Fold","sections":[{"paragraph":"An enclosure for flocks to rest together (Isa. 13:20). Sheep-folds are mentioned Num. 32:16, 24, 36; 2 Sam. 7:8; Zeph. 2:6; John 10:1, etc. It was prophesied of the cities of Ammon (Ezek. 25:5), Aroer (Isa. 17:2), and Judaea, that they would be folds or couching-places for flocks. \"Among the pots,\" of the Authorized Version (Ps. 68:13), is rightly in the Revised Version, \"among the sheepfolds.\""}]}
