{"word":"Harp","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Heb. kinnor), the national instrument of the Hebrews. It was invented by Jubal (Gen. 4:21). Some think the word kinnor denotes the whole class of stringed instruments. It was used as an accompaniment to songs of cheerfulness as well as of praise to God (Gen. 31:27; 1 Sam. 16:23; 2 Chr. 20:28; Ps. 33:2; 137:2)."},{"paragraph":"In Solomon\u0027s time harps were made of almug-trees (1 Kings 10:11, 12). In 1 Chr. 15:21 mention is made of \"harps on the Sheminith;\" Revised Version, \"harps set to the Sheminith;\" better perhaps \"harps of eight strings.\" The soothing effect of the music of the harp is referred to 1 Sam. 16:16, 23; 18:10; 19:9. The church in heaven is represented as celebrating the triumphs of the Redeemer \"harping with their harps\" (Rev. 14:2)."}]}
