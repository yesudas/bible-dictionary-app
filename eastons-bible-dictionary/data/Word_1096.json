{"word":"Dust","sections":[{"paragraph":"Storms of sand and dust sometimes overtake Eastern travellers. They are very dreadful, many perishing under them. Jehovah threatens to bring on the land of Israel, as a punishment for forsaking him, a rain of \"powder and dust\" (Deut. 28:24)."},{"paragraph":"To cast dust on the head was a sign of mourning (Josh. 7:6); and to sit in dust, of extreme affliction (Isa. 47:1). \"Dust\" is used to denote the grave (Job 7:21). \"To shake off the dust from one\u0027s feet\" against another is to renounce all future intercourse with him (Matt. 10:14; Acts 13:51). To \"lick the dust\" is a sign of abject submission (Ps. 72:9); and to throw dust at one is a sign of abhorrence (2 Sam. 16:13; comp. Acts 22:23)."}]}
