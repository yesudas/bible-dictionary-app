{"word":"College","sections":[{"paragraph":"Heb. mishneh (2 Kings 22:14; 2 Chr. 34:22), rendered in Revised Version \"second quarter\", the residence of the prophetess Huldah. The Authorized Version followed the Jewish commentators, who, following the Targum, gave the Hebrew word its post-Biblical sense, as if it meant a place of instruction. It properly means the \"second,\" and may therefore denote the lower city (Acra), which was built after the portion of the city on Mount Zion, and was enclosed by a second wall."}]}
