{"word":"Migdol","sections":[{"paragraph":"Tower. (1.) A strongly-fortified place 12 miles from Pelusium, in the north of Egypt (Jer. 44:1; 46:14). This word is rendered \"tower\" in Ezek. 29:10, but the margin correctly retains the name Migdol, \"from Migdol to Syene;\" i.e., from Migdol in the north to Syene in the south, in other words, the whole of Egypt."},{"paragraph":"(2.) A place mentioned in the passage of the Red Sea (Ex. 14:2; Num. 33:7, 8). It is probably to be identified with Bir Suweis, about 2 miles from Suez."}]}
