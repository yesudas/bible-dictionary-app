{"word":"Solomon, Song of","sections":[{"paragraph":"Called also, after the Vulgate, the \"Canticles.\" It is the \"song of songs\" (1:1), as being the finest and most precious of its kind; the noblest song, \"das Hohelied,\" as Luther calls it. The Solomonic authorship of this book has been called in question, but evidences, both internal and external, fairly establish the traditional view that it is the product of Solomon\u0027s pen. It is an allegorical poem setting forth the mutual love of Christ and the Church, under the emblem of the bridegroom and the bride. (Compare Matt. 9:15; John 3:29; Eph. 5:23, 27, 29; Rev. 19:7-9; 21:2, 9; 22:17. Compare also Ps. 45; Isa. 54:4-6; 62:4, 5; Jer. 2:2; 3:1, 20; Ezek. 16; Hos. 2:16, 19, 20.)"}]}
