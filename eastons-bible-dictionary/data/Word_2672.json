{"word":"Nathanael","sections":[{"paragraph":"Given or gift of God, one of our Lord\u0027s disciples, \"of Cana in Galilee\" (John 21:2). He was \"an Israelite indeed, in whom was no guile\" (1:47, 48). His name occurs only in the Gospel of John, who in his list of the disciples never mentions Bartholomew, with whom he has consequently been identified. He was one of those to whom the Lord showed himself alive after his resurrection, at the Sea of Tiberias."}]}
