{"word":"Fever","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Deut. 28:22; Matt. 8:14; Mark 1:30; John 4:52; Acts 28:8), a burning heat, as the word so rendered denotes, which attends all febrile attacks. In all Eastern countries such diseases are very common. Peter\u0027s wife\u0027s mother is said to have suffered from a \"great fever\" (Luke 4:38), an instance of Luke\u0027s professional exactitude in describing disease. He adopts here the technical medical distinction, as in those times fevers were divided into the \"great\" and the \"less.\""}]}
