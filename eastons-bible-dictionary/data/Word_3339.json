{"word":"Shem","sections":[{"paragraph":"A name; renown, the first mentioned of the sons of Noah (Gen. 5:32; 6:10). He was probably the eldest of Noah\u0027s sons. The words \"brother of Japheth the elder\" in Gen. 10:21 are more correctly rendered \"the elder brother of Japheth,\" as in the Revised Version. Shem\u0027s name is generally mentioned first in the list of Noah\u0027s sons. He and his wife were saved in the ark (7:13). Noah foretold his preeminence over Canaan (9:23-27). He died at the age of six hundred years, having been for many years contemporary with Abraham, according to the usual chronology. The Israelitish nation sprang from him (Gen. 11:10-26; 1 Chr. 1:24-27)."}]}
