{"word":"Comforter","sections":[{"paragraph":"The designation of the Holy Ghost (John 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7; R.V. marg., \"or Advocate, or Helper; Gr. paracletos\"). The same Greek word thus rendered is translated \"Advocate\" in 1 John 2:1 as applicable to Christ. It means properly \"one who is summoned to the side of another\" to help him in a court of justice by defending him, \"one who is summoned to plead a cause.\" \"Advocate\" is the proper rendering of the word in every case where it occurs."},{"paragraph":"It is worthy of notice that although Paul nowhere uses the word paracletos, he yet presents the idea it embodies when he speaks of the \"intercession\" both of Christ and the Spirit (Rom. 8:27, 34)."}]}
