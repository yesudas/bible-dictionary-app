{"word":"Trophimus","sections":[{"paragraph":"A foster-child, an Ephesian who accompanied Paul during a part of his third missionary journey (Acts 20:4; 21:29). He was with Paul in Jerusalem, and the Jews, supposing that the apostle had brought him with him into the temple, raised a tumult which resulted in Paul\u0027s imprisonment. (See [646]TEMPLE, HEROD\u0027S.) In writing to Timothy, the apostle says, \"Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick\" (2 Tim. 4:20). This must refer to some event not noticed in the Acts."}]}
