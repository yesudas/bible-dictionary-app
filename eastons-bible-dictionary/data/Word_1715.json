{"word":"Heir","sections":[{"paragraph":"Under the patriarchs the property of a father was divided among the sons of his legitimate wives (Gen. 21:10; 24:36; 25:5), the eldest son getting a larger portion than the rest. The Mosaic law made specific regulations regarding the transmission of real property, which are given in detail in Deut. 21:17; Num. 27:8; 36:6; 27:9-11. Succession to property was a matter of right and not of favour. Christ is the \"heir of all things\" (Heb. 1:2; Col. 1:15). Believers are heirs of the \"promise,\" \"of righteousness,\" \"of the kingdom,\" \"of the world,\" \"of God,\" \"joint heirs\" with Christ (Gal 3:29; Heb. 6:17; 11:7; James 2:5; Rom. 4:13; 8:17)."}]}
