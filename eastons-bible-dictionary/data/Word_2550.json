{"word":"Mill","sections":[{"paragraph":"For grinding corn, mentioned as used in the time of Abraham (Gen. 18:6). That used by the Hebrews consisted of two circular stones, each 2 feet in diameter and half a foot thick, the lower of which was called the \"nether millstone\" (Job 41:24) and the upper the \"rider.\" The upper stone was turned round by a stick fixed in it as a handle. There were then no public mills, and thus each family required to be provided with a hand-mill. The corn was ground daily, generally by the women of the house (Isa. 47:1, 2; Matt. 24:41). It was with the upper stone of a hand-mill that \"a certain woman\" at Thebez broke Abimelech\u0027s skull (Judg. 9:53, \"a piece of a millstone;\" literally, \"a millstone rider\", i.e., the \"runner,\" the stone which revolves. Comp. 2 Sam. 11:21). Millstones could not be pledged (Deut. 24:6), as they were necessary in every family."}]}
