{"word":"Cilicia","sections":[{"paragraph":"A maritime province in the south-east of Asia Minor. Tarsus, the birth-place of Paul, was one of its chief towns, and the seat of a celebrated school of philosophy. Its luxurious climate attracted to it many Greek residents after its incorporation with the Macedonian empire. It was formed into a Roman province, B.C. 67. The Jews of Cilicia had a synagogue at Jerusalem (Acts 6:9). Paul visited it soon after his conversion (Gal. 1:21; Acts 9:30), and again, on his second missionary journey (15:41), \"he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.\" It was famous for its goat\u0027s-hair cloth, called cilicium. Paul learned in his youth the trade of making tents of this cloth."}]}
