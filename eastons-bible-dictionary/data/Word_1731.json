{"word":"Hell","sections":[{"paragraph":"Derived from the Saxon helan, to cover; hence the covered or the invisible place. In Scripture there are three words so rendered:"},{"paragraph":"(1.) Sheol, occurring in the Old Testament sixty-five times. This word sheol is derived from a root-word meaning \"to ask,\" \"demand;\" hence insatiableness (Prov. 30:15, 16). It is rendered \"grave\" thirty-one times (Gen. 37:35; 42:38; 44:29, 31; 1 Sam. 2:6, etc.). The Revisers have retained this rendering in the historical books with the original word in the margin, while in the poetical books they have reversed this rule."},{"paragraph":"In thirty-one cases in the Authorized Version this word is rendered \"hell,\" the place of disembodied spirits. The inhabitants of sheol are \"the congregation of the dead\" (Prov. 21:16). It is (a) the abode of the wicked (Num. 16:33; Job 24:19; Ps. 9:17; 31:17, etc.); (b) of the good (Ps. 16:10; 30:3; 49:15; 86:13, etc.)."},{"paragraph":"Sheol is described as deep (Job 11:8), dark (10:21, 22), with bars (17:16). The dead \"go down\" to it (Num. 16:30, 33; Ezek. 31:15, 16, 17)."},{"paragraph":"(2.) The Greek word hades of the New Testament has the same scope of signification as sheol of the Old Testament. It is a prison (1 Pet. 3:19), with gates and bars and locks (Matt. 16:18; Rev. 1:18), and it is downward (Matt. 11:23; Luke 10:15)."},{"paragraph":"The righteous and the wicked are separated. The blessed dead are in that part of hades called paradise (Luke 23:43). They are also said to be in Abraham\u0027s bosom (Luke 16:22)."},{"paragraph":"(3.) Gehenna, in most of its occurrences in the Greek New Testament, designates the place of the lost (Matt. 23:33). The fearful nature of their condition there is described in various figurative expressions (Matt. 8:12; 13:42; 22:13; 25:30; Luke 16:24, etc.). (See [269]HINNOM.)"}]}
