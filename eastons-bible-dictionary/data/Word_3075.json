{"word":"Raven","sections":[{"paragraph":"Heb. orebh, from a root meaning \"to be black\" (comp. Cant. 5:11); first mentioned as \"sent forth\" by Noah from the ark (Gen. 8:7). \"Every raven after his kind\" was forbidden as food (Lev. 11:15; Deut. 14:14). Ravens feed mostly on carrion, and hence their food is procured with difficulty (Job 38:41; Ps. 147:9). When they attack kids or lambs or weak animals, it is said that they first pick out the eyes of their victims (Prov. 30:17). When Elijah was concealed by the brook Cherith, God commanded the ravens to bring him \"bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening\" (1 Kings 17:3-6). (See [522]ELIJAH.)"},{"paragraph":"There are eight species of ravens in Palestine, and they are everywhere very numerous in that land."}]}
