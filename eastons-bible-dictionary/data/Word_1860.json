{"word":"Ichabod","sections":[{"paragraph":"When the tidings of the disastrous defeat of the Israelites in the battle against the Philistines near to Mizpeh were carried to Shiloh, the wife of Phinehas \"was near to be delivered. And when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed\" (1 Sam. 4:19-22). In her great distress she regarded not \"the women that stood by her,\" but named the child that was born \"Ichabod\" i.e., no glory, saying, \"The glory is departed from Isreal;\" and with that word on her lips she expired."}]}
