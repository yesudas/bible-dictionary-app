{"word":"Yarn","sections":[{"paragraph":"Found only in 1 Kings 10:28, 2 Chr. 1:16. The Heb. word mikveh, i.e., \"a stringing together,\" so rendered, rather signifies a host, or company, or a string of horses. The Authorized Version has: \"And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king\u0027s merchants received the linen yarn at a price;\" but the Revised Version correctly renders: \"And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; the king\u0027s merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.\""}]}
