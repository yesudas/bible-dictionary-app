{"word":"Gier eagle","sections":[{"paragraph":"Heb. raham \u003d \"parental affection,\" Lev. 11:18; Deut. 14:17; R.V., \"vulture\"), a species of vulture living entirely on carrion. \"It is about the size of a raven; has an almost triangular, bald, and wrinkled head, a strong pointed beak, black at the tip, large eyes and ears, the latter entirely on the outside, and long feet.\" It is common in Egypt, where it is popularly called \"Pharaoh\u0027s chicken\" (the Neophron percnopterus), and is found in Palestine only during summer. Tristram thinks that the Hebrew name, which is derived from a root meaning \"to love,\" is given to it from the fact that the male and female bird never part company."}]}
