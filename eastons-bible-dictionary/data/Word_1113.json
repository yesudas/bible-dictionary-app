{"word":"East wind","sections":[{"paragraph":"The wind coming from the east (Job 27:21; Isa. 27:8, etc.). Blight caused by this wind, \"thin ears\" (Gen. 41:6); the withered \"gourd\" (Jonah 4: 8). It was the cause and also the emblem of evil (Ezek. 17:10; 19:12; Hos. 13:15). In Palestine this wind blows from a burning desert, and hence is destitute of moisture necessary for vegetation."}]}
