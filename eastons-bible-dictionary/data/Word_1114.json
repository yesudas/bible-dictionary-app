{"word":"Eating","sections":[{"paragraph":"The ancient Hebrews would not eat with the Egyptians (Gen. 43:32). In the time of our Lord they would not eat with Samaritans (John 4:9), and were astonished that he ate with publicans and sinners (Matt. 9:11).

In John 6:53-58, \"eating and drinking\" means believing in Christ. Women were never present as guests at meals (q.v.)."}]}
