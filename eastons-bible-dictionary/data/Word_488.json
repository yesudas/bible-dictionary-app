Hence the import of Ezekiel\u0027s (5:1-4) description of the \"razor\" i.e., the agents of an angry providence being used against the guilty nation of the Jews. It was a part of a Jew\u0027s daily toilet to anoint his beard with oil and perfume (Ps. 133:2). Beards were trimmed with the most fastidious care (2 Sam. 19:24), and their neglet was an indication of deep sorrow (Isa. 15:2; Jer. 41:5). The custom was to shave or pluck off the hair as a sign of mourning (Isa. 50:6; Jer. 48:37; Ezra 9:3). The beards of David\u0027s ambassadors were cut off by hanun (2 Sam. 10:4) as a mark of indignity."},{"paragraph":"On the other hand, the Egyptians carefully shaved the hair off their faces, and they compelled their slaves to do so also (Gen. 41:14)."}]}
