{"word":"Seleucia","sections":[{"paragraph":"The sea-port of Antioch, near the mouth of the Orontes. Paul and his companions sailed from this port on their first missionary journey (Acts 13:4). This city was built by Seleucus Nicator, the \"king of Syria.\" It is said of him that \"few princes have ever lived with so great a passion for the building of cities. He is reputed to have built in all nine Seleucias, sixteen Antiochs, and six Laodiceas.\" Seleucia became a city of great importance, and was made a \"free city\" by Pompey. It is now a small village, called el-Kalusi."}]}
