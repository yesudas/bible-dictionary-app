{"word":"Trance","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Gr. ekstasis, from which the word \"ecstasy\" is derived) denotes the state of one who is \"out of himself.\" Such were the trances of Peter and Paul, Acts 10:10; 11:5; 22:17, ecstasies, \"a preternatural, absorbed state of mind preparing for the reception of the vision\", (comp. 2 Cor. 12:1-4). In Mark 5:42 and Luke 5:26 the Greek word is rendered \"astonishment,\" \"amazement\" (comp. Mark 16:8; Acts 3:10)."}]}
