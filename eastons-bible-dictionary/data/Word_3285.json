{"word":"Sergius Paulus","sections":[{"paragraph":"A \"prudent man\" (R.V., \"man of understanding\"), the deputy (R.V., \"proconsul\") of Cyprus (Acts 13:6-13). He became a convert to Christianity under Paul, who visited this island on his first mission to the heathen."},{"paragraph":"A remarkable memorial of this proconsul was recently (1887) discovered at Rome. On a boundary stone of Claudius his name is found, among others, as having been appointed (A.D. 47) one of the curators of the banks and the channel of the river Tiber. After serving his three years as proconsul at Cyprus, he returned to Rome, where he held the office referred to. As he is not saluted in Paul\u0027s letter to the Romans, he probably died before it was written."}]}
