{"word":"Ox goad","sections":[{"paragraph":"Mentioned only in Judg. 3:31, the weapon with which Shamgar (q.v.) slew six hundred Philistines. \"The ploughman still carries his goad, a weapon apparently more fitted for the hand of the soldier than the peaceful husbandman. The one I saw was of the oak of Bashan,\u0027 and measured upwards of ten feet in length. At one end was an iron spear, and at the other a piece of the same metal flattened. One can well understand how a warrior might use such a weapon with effect in the battle-field\" (Porter\u0027s Syria, etc.). (See [456]GOAD.)"}]}
