{"word":"Child","sections":[{"paragraph":"This word has considerable latitude of meaning in Scripture. Thus Joseph is called a child at the time when he was probably about sixteen years of age (Gen. 37:3); and Benjamin is so called when he was above thirty years (44:20). Solomon called himself a little child when he came to the kingdom (1 Kings 3:7)."},{"paragraph":"The descendants of a man, however remote, are called his children; as, \"the children of Edom,\" \"the children of Moab,\" \"the children of Israel.\""},{"paragraph":"In the earliest times mothers did not wean their children till they were from thirty months to three years old; and the day on which they were weaned was kept as a festival day (Gen. 21:8; Ex. 2:7, 9; 1 Sam. 1:22-24; Matt. 21:16). At the age of five, children began to learn the arts and duties of life under the care of their fathers (Deut. 6:20-25; 11:19)."},{"paragraph":"To have a numerous family was regarded as a mark of divine favour (Gen. 11:30; 30:1; 1 Sam. 2:5; 2 Sam. 6:23; Ps. 127:3; 128:3)."},{"paragraph":"Figuratively the name is used for those who are ignorant or narrow-minded (Matt. 11:16; Luke 7:32; 1 Cor. 13:11). \"When I was a child, I spake as a child.\" \"Brethren, be not children in understanding\" (1 Cor. 14:20). \"That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro\" (Eph. 4:14)."},{"paragraph":"Children are also spoken of as representing simplicity and humility (Matt. 19:13-15; Mark 10:13-16; Luke 18:15-17). Believers are \"children of light\" (Luke 16:8; 1 Thess. 5:5) and \"children of obedience\" (1 Pet. 1:14)."}]}
