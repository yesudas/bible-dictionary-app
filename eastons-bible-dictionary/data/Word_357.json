{"word":"Atad","sections":[{"paragraph":"Buckthorn, a place where Joseph and his brethren, when on their way from Egypt to Hebron with the remains of their father Jacob, made for seven days a \"great and very sore lamentation.\" On this account the Canaanites called it \"Abel-mizraim\" (Gen. 50:10, 11). It was probably near Hebron. The word is rendered \"bramble\" in Judg. 9:14, 15, and \"thorns\" in Ps. 58:9."}]}
