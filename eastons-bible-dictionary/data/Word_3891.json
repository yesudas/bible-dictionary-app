{"word":"Zebulun, Tribe of","sections":[{"paragraph":"Numbered at Sinai (Num. 1:31) and before entering Canaan (26:27). It was one of the tribes which did not drive out the Canaanites, but only made them tributary (Judg. 1:30). It took little interest in public affairs. It responded, however, readily to the summons of Gideon (6:35), and afterwards assisted in enthroning David at Hebron (1 Chr. 12:33, 40). Along with the other northern tribes, Zebulun was carried away into the land of Assyria by Tiglath-pileser (2 Kings 15:29)."},{"paragraph":"In Deborah\u0027s song the words, \"Out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer\" (Judg. 5:14) has been rendered in the R.V., \"They that handle the marshal\u0027s staff.\" This is a questionable rendering. \"The word sopher (scribe\u0027 or \u0027writer\u0027) defines the word shebhet (rod\u0027 or pen\u0027) with which it is conjoined. The rod of the scribe\u0027 on the Assyrian monuments was the stylus of wood or metal, with the help of which the clay tablet was engraved, or the papyrus inscribed with characters. The scribe who wielded it was the associate and assistant of the lawgivers.\u0027\" (Sayce)."}]}
