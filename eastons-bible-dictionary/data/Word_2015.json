{"word":"Jehoshaphat, Valley of","sections":[{"paragraph":"Mentioned in Scripture only in Joel 3:2, 12. This is the name given in modern times to the valley between Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives, and the Kidron flows through it. Here Jehoshaphat overthrew the confederated enemies of Israel (Ps. 83:6-8); and in this valley also God was to overthrow the Tyrians, Zidonians, etc. (Joel 3:4, 19), with an utter overthrow. This has been fulfilled; but Joel speaks of the final conflict, when God would destroy all Jerusalem\u0027s enemies, of whom Tyre and Zidon, etc., were types. The \"valley of Jehoshaphat\" may therefore be simply regarded as a general term for the theatre of God\u0027s final judgments on the enemies of Israel."},{"paragraph":"This valley has from ancient times been used by the Jews as a burial-ground. It is all over paved with flat stones as tombstones, bearing on them Hebrew inscriptions."}]}
