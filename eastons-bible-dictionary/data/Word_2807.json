{"word":"Orphans","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Lam. 5:3), i.e., desolate and without protectors. The word occurs only here. In John 14:18 the word there rendered \"comfortless\" (R.V., \"desolate;\" marg., \"orphans\") properly means \"orphans.\" The same Greek word is rendered \"fatherless\" in James 1:27."}]}
