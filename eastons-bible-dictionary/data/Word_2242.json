{"word":"Lapwing","sections":[{"paragraph":"The name of an unclean bird, mentioned only in Lev. 11:19 and Deut. 14:18. The Hebrew name of this bird, dukiphath, has been generally regarded as denoting the hoope (Upupa epops), an onomatopoetic word derived from the cry of the bird, which resembles the word \"hoop;\" a bird not uncommon in Palestine. Others identify it with the English peewit."}]}
