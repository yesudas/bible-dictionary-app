{"word":"Herdsman","sections":[{"paragraph":"In Egypt herdsmen were probably of the lowest caste. Some of Joseph\u0027s brethren were made rulers over Pharaoh\u0027s cattle (Gen. 47:6, 17). The Israelites were known in Egypt as \"keepers of cattle;\" and when they left it they took their flocks and herds with them (Ex. 12:38). Both David and Saul came from \"following the herd\" to occupy the throne (1 Sam. 9; 11:5; Ps. 78:70). David\u0027s herd-masters were among his chief officers of state. The daughters also of wealthy chiefs were wont to tend the flocks of the family (Gen. 29:9; Ex. 2:16). The \"chief of the herdsmen\" was in the time of the monarchy an officer of high rank (1 Sam. 21:7; comp. 1 Chr. 27:29). The herdsmen lived in tents (Isa. 38:12; Jer. 6:3); and there were folds for the cattle (Num. 32:16), and watch-towers for the herdsmen, that he might therefrom observe any coming danger (Micah 4:8; Nah. 3:8)."}]}
