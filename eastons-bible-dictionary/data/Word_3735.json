{"word":"Type","sections":[{"paragraph":"Occurs only once in Scripture (1 Cor. 10:11, A.V. marg.). The Greek word tupos is rendered \"print\" (John 20:25), \"figure\" (Acts 7:43; Rom. 5:14), \"fashion\" (Acts 7:44), \"manner\" (Acts 23:25), \"form\" (Rom. 6:17), \"example\" or \"ensample\" (1 Cor. 10:6, 11; Phil. 3:17; 1 Thess. 1:7; 2 Thess. 3:9; 1 Tim. 4:12). It properly means a \"model\" or \"pattern\" or \"mould\" into which clay or wax was pressed, that it might take the figure or exact shape of the mould. The word \"type\" is generally used to denote a resemblance between something present and something future, which is called the \"antitype.\""}]}
