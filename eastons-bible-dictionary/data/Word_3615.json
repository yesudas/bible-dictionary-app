{"word":"Tent","sections":[{"paragraph":"(1.) Heb. ohel (Gen. 9:21, 27). This word is used also of a dwelling or habitation (1 Kings 8:66; Isa. 16:5; Jer. 4:20), and of the temple (Ezek. 41:1). When used of the tabernacle, as in 1 Kings 1:39, it denotes the covering of goat\u0027s hair which was placed over the mishcan."},{"paragraph":"(2.) Heb. mishcan (Cant. 1:8), used also of a dwelling (Job 18:21; Ps. 87:2), the grave (Isa. 22:16; comp. 14:18), the temple (Ps. 46:4; 84:2; 132:5), and of the tabernacle (Ex. 25:9; 26:1; 40:9; Num. 1:50, 53; 10:11). When distinguished from \u0027ohel, it denotes the twelve interior curtains which lay upon the framework of the tabernacle (q.v.)."},{"paragraph":"(3.) Heb. kubbah (Num. 25:8), a dome-like tent devoted to the impure worship of Baal-peor."},{"paragraph":"(4.) Heb. succah (2 Sam. 11:11), a tent or booth made of green boughs or branches (see Gen. 33:17; Lev. 23:34, 42; Ps. 18:11; Jonah 4:5; Isa. 4:6; Neh. 8:15-17, where the word is variously rendered)."},{"paragraph":"Jubal was \"the father of such as dwell in tents\" (Gen. 4:20). The patriarchs were \"dwellers in tents\" (Gen. 9:21, 27; 12:8; 13:12; 26:17); and during their wilderness wanderings all Israel dwelt in tents (Ex. 16:16; Deut. 33:18; Josh. 7:24). Tents have always occupied a prominent place in Eastern life (1 Sam. 17:54; 2 Kings 7:7; Ps. 120:5; Cant. 1:5). Paul the apostle\u0027s occupation was that of a tent-maker (Acts 18:3); i.e., perhaps a maker of tent cloth."}]}
