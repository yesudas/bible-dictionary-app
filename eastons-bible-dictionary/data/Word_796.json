{"word":"Chestnut tree","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Heb. \u0027armon; i.e., \"naked\"), mentioned in connection with Jacob\u0027s artifice regarding the cattle (Gen. 30:37). It is one of the trees of which, because of its strength and beauty, the Assyrian empire is likened (Ezek. 31:8; R.V., \"plane trees\"). It is probably the Oriental plane tree (Platanus orientalis) that is intended. It is a characteristic of this tree that it annually sheds its outer bark, becomes \"naked.\" The chestnut tree proper is not a native of Palestine."}]}
