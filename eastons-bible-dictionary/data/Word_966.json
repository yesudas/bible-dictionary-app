{"word":"Damnation","sections":[{"paragraph":"In Rom. 13:2, means \"condemnation,\" which comes on those who withstand God\u0027s ordinance of magistracy. This sentence of condemnation comes not from the magistrate, but from God, whose authority is thus resisted."},{"paragraph":"In 1 Cor. 11:29 (R.V., \"judgment\") this word means condemnation, in the sense of exposure to severe temporal judgements from God, as the following verse explains."},{"paragraph":"In Rom. 14:23 the word \"damned\" means \"condemned\" by one\u0027s own conscience, as well as by the Word of God. The apostle shows here that many things which are lawful are not expedient; and that in using our Christian liberty the question should not simply be, Is this course I follow lawful? but also, Can I follow it without doing injury to the spiritual interests of a brother in Christ? He that \"doubteth\", i.e., is not clear in his conscience as to \"meats\", will violate his conscience \"if he eat,\" and in eating is condemned; and thus one ought not so to use his liberty as to lead one who is \"weak\" to bring upon himself this condemnation."}]}
