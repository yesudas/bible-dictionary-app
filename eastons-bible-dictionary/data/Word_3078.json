{"word":"Rebekah","sections":[{"paragraph":"A noose, the daughter of Bethuel, and the wife of Isaac (Gen. 22:23; 24:67). The circumstances under which Abraham\u0027s \"steward\" found her at the \"city of Nahor,\" in Padan-aram, are narrated in Gen. 24-27. \"She can hardly be regarded as an amiable woman. When we first see her she is ready to leave her father\u0027s house for ever at an hour\u0027s notice; and her future life showed not only a full share of her brother Laban\u0027s duplicity, but the grave fault of partiality in her relations to her children, and a strong will, which soon controlled the gentler nature of her husband.\" The time and circumstances of her death are not recorded, but it is said that she was buried in the cave of Machpelah (Gen. 49:31)."}]}
