{"word":"Burnt offering","sections":[{"paragraph":"Hebrew olah; i.e., \"ascending,\" the whole being consumed by fire, and regarded as ascending to God while being consumed. Part of every offering was burnt in the sacred fire, but this was wholly burnt, a \"whole burnt offering.\" It was the most frequent form of sacrifice, and apparently the only one mentioned in the book of Genesis. Such were the sacrifices offered by Abel (Gen. 4:3, 4, here called minhah; i.e., \"a gift\"), Noah (Gen. 8:20), Abraham (Gen. 22:2, 7, 8, 13), and by the Hebrews in Egypt (Ex. 10:25)."},{"paragraph":"The law of Moses afterwards prescribed the occasions and the manner in which burnt sacrifices were to be offered. There were \"the continual burnt offering\" (Ex. 29:38-42; Lev. 6:9-13), \"the burnt offering of every sabbath,\" which was double the daily one (Num. 28:9, 10), \"the burnt offering of every month\" (28:11-15), the offerings at the Passover (19-23), at Pentecost (Lev. 23:16), the feast of Trumpets (23:23-25), and on the day of Atonement (Lev. 16)."},{"paragraph":"On other occasions special sacrifices were offered, as at the consecration of Aaron (Ex. 29) and the dedication of the temple (1 Kings 8:5, 62-64)."},{"paragraph":"Free-will burnt offerings were also permitted (Lev. 1:13), and were offered at the accession of Solomon to the throne (1 Chr. 29:21), and at the reformation brought about by Hezekiah (2 Chr. 29: 31-35)."},{"paragraph":"These offerings signified the complete dedication of the offerers unto God. This is referred to in Rom. 12:1. (See [85]ALTAR, [86]SACRIFICE.)"}]}
