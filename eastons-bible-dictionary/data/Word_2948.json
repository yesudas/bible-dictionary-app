{"word":"Physician","sections":[{"paragraph":"Asa, afflicted with some bodily malady, \"sought not to the Lord but to the physicians\" (2 Chr. 16:12). The \"physicians\" were those who \"practised heathen arts of magic, disavowing recognized methods of cure, and dissociating the healing art from dependence on the God of Israel. The sin of Asa was not, therefore, in seeking medical advice, as we understand the phrase, but in forgetting Jehovah.\""}]}
