{"word":"Nabal","sections":[{"paragraph":"Foolish, a descendant of Caleb who dwelt at Maon (1 Sam. 25), the modern Main, 7 miles south-east of Hebron. He was \"very great, and he had 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats...but the man was churlish and evil in his doings.\" During his wanderings David came into that district, and hearing that Nabal was about to shear his sheep, he sent ten of his young men to ask \"whatsoever cometh unto thy hand for thy servants.\" Nabal insultingly resented the demand, saying, \"Who is David, and who is the son of Jesse?\" (1 Sam. 25:10, 11). One of the shepherds that stood by and saw the reception David\u0027s messengers had met with, informed Abigail, Nabal\u0027s wife, who at once realized the danger that threatened her household. She forthwith proceeded to the camp of David, bringing with her ample stores of provisions (25:18). She so courteously and persuasively pled her cause that David\u0027s anger was appeased, and he said to her, \"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel which sent thee this day to meet me.\""},{"paragraph":"On her return she found her husband incapable from drunkenness of understanding the state of matters, and not till the following day did she explain to him what had happened. He was stunned by a sense of the danger to which his conduct had exposed him. \"His heart died within him, and he became as a stone.\" and about ten days after \"the Lord smote Nabal that he died\" (1 Sam. 25:37, 38). Not long after David married Abigail (q.v.)."}]}
