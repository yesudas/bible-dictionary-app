{"word":"Glory","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Heb. kabhod; Gr. doxa). (1.) Abundance, wealth, treasure, and hence honour (Ps. 49:12); glory (Gen. 31:1; Matt. 4:8; Rev. 21:24, 26)."},{"paragraph":"(2.) Honour, dignity (1 Kings 3:13; Heb. 2:7 1 Pet. 1:24); of God (Ps. 19:1; 29:1); of the mind or heart (Gen. 49:6; Ps. 7:5; Acts 2:46)."},{"paragraph":"(3.) Splendour, brightness, majesty (Gen. 45:13; Isa. 4:5; Acts 22:11; 2 Cor. 3:7); of Jehovah (Isa. 59:19; 60:1; 2 Thess. 1:9)."},{"paragraph":"(4.) The glorious moral attributes, the infinite perfections of God (Isa. 40:5; Acts 7:2; Rom. 1:23; 9:23; Eph. 1:12). Jesus is the \"brightness of the Father\u0027s glory\" (Heb. 1:3; John 1:14; 2:11)."},{"paragraph":"(5.) The bliss of heaven (Rom. 2:7, 10; 5:2; 8:18; Heb. 2:10; 1 Pet. 5:1, 10)."},{"paragraph":"(6.) The phrase \"Give glory to God\" (Josh. 7:19; Jer. 13:16) is a Hebrew idiom meaning, \"Confess your sins.\" The words of the Jews to the blind man, \"Give God the praise\" (John 9:24), are an adjuration to confess. They are equivalent to, \"Confess that you are an impostor,\" \"Give God the glory by speaking the truth;\" for they denied that a miracle had been wrought."}]}
