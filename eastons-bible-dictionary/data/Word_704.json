{"word":"Canaanite","sections":[{"paragraph":"A name given to the apostle Simon (Matt. 10:4; Mark 3:18). The word here does not, however, mean a descendant of Canaan, but is a translation, or rather almost a transliteration, of the Syriac word Kanenyeh (R.V. rendered \"Cananaen\"), which designates the Jewish sect of the Zealots. Hence he is called elsewhere (Luke 6:15) \"Simon Zelotes;\" i.e., Simon of the sect of the Zealots. (See [94]SIMON.)"}]}
