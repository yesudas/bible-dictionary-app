{"word":"Kirjath-jearim","sections":[{"paragraph":"City of jaars; i.e., of woods or forests, a Gibeonite town (Josh. 9:17) on the border of Benjamin, to which tribe it was assigned (18:15, 28). The ark was brought to this place (1 Sam. 7:1, 2) from Beth-shemesh and put in charge of Abinadab, a Levite. Here it remained till it was removed by David to Jerusalem (2 Sam. 6:2, 3, 12; 1 Chr. 15:1-29; comp. Ps. 132). It was also called Baalah (Josh. 15:9) and Kirjath-baal (60). It has been usually identified with Kuriet el-Enab (i.e., \"city of grapes\"), among the hills, about 8 miles north-east of Ain Shems (i.e., Beth-shemesh). The opinion, however, that it is to be identified with Erma, 4 miles east of Ain Shems, on the edge of the valley of Sorek, seems to be better supported. (See [342]KIRJATH.)"},{"paragraph":"The words of Ps. 132:6, \"We found it in the fields of the wood,\" refer to the sojourn of the ark at Kirjath-jearim. \"Wood\" is here the rendering of the Hebrew word jaar, which is the singular of jearim."}]}
