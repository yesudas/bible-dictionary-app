{"word":"Garrison","sections":[{"paragraph":"(1.) Heb. matstsab, a station; a place where one stands (1 Sam. 14:12); a military or fortified post (1 Sam. 13:23; 14:1, 4, 6, etc.)."},{"paragraph":"(2.) Heb. netsib, a prefect, superintendent; hence a military post (1 Sam. 10:5; 13:3, 4; 2 Sam. 8:6). This word has also been explained to denote a pillar set up to mark the Philistine conquest, or an officer appointed to collect taxes; but the idea of a military post seems to be the correct one."},{"paragraph":"(3.) Heb. matstsebah, properly a monumental column; improperly rendered pl. \"garrisons\" in Ezek. 26:11; correctly in Revised Version \"pillars,\" marg. \"obelisks,\" probably an idolatrous image."}]}
