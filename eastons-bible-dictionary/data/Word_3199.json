This valley (the\u0027 Arabah) is between Judah and Edom on the south of the Dead Sea. Hence some interpreters would insert the words, \"and he smote Edom,\" after the words, \"Syrians\" in the above text. It is conjectured that while David was leading his army against the Ammonites and Syrians, the Edomites invaded the south of Judah, and that David sent Joab or Abishai against them, who drove them back and finally subdued Edom.
