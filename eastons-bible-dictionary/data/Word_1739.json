{"word":"Hemlock","sections":[{"paragraph":"(1.) Heb. rosh (Hos. 10:4; rendered \"gall\" in Deut. 29:18; 32:32; Ps. 69:21; Jer. 9:15; 23:15; \"poison,\" Job 20:16; \"venom,\" Deut. 32:33). \"Rosh is the name of some poisonous plant which grows quickly and luxuriantly; of a bitter taste, and therefore coupled with wormwood (Deut. 29:18; Lam. 3:19). Hence it would seem to be not the hemlock cicuta, nor the colocynth or wild gourd, nor lolium darnel, but the poppy so called from its heads\" (Gesenius, Lex.)."},{"paragraph":"(2.) Heb. la\u0027anah, generally rendered \"wormwood\" (q.v.), Deut. 29:18, Text 17; Prov. 5:4; Jer. 9:15; 23:15. Once it is rendered \"hemlock\" (Amos 6:12; R.V., \"wormwood\"). This Hebrew word is from a root meaning \"to curse,\" hence the accursed."}]}
