{"word":"Black","sections":[{"paragraph":"Properly the absence of all colour. In Prov. 7:9 the Hebrew word means, as in the margin of the Revised Version, \"the pupil of the eye.\" It is translated \"apple\" of the eye in Deut. 32:10; Ps. 17:8; Prov. 7:2. It is a different word which is rendered \"black\" in Lev. 13:31, 37; Cant. 1:5; 5:11; and Zech. 6:2, 6. It is uncertain what the \"black marble\" of Esther 1:6 was which formed a part of the mosaic pavement."}]}
