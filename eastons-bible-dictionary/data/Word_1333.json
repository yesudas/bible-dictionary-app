{"word":"Fir","sections":[{"paragraph":"The uniform rendering in the Authorized Version (marg. R.V., \"cypress\") of berosh (2 Sam. 6:5; 1 Kings 5:8, 10; 6:15, 34; 9:11, etc.), a lofty tree (Isa. 55:13) growing on Lebanon (37:24). Its wood was used in making musical instruments and doors of houses, and for ceilings (2 Chr. 3:5), the decks of ships (Ezek. 27:5), floorings and spear-shafts (Nah. 2:3, R.V.). The true fir (abies) is not found in Palestine, but the pine tree, of which there are four species, is common."},{"paragraph":"The precise kind of tree meant by the \"green fir tree\" (Hos. 14:8) is uncertain. Some regard it as the sherbin tree, a cypress resembling the cedar; others, the Aleppo or maritime pine (Pinus halepensis), which resembles the Scotch fir; while others think that the \"stone-pine\" (Pinus pinea) is probably meant. (See [210]PINE.)"}]}
