{"word":"Hypocrite","sections":[{"paragraph":"One who puts on a mask and feigns himself to be what he is not; a dissembler in religion. Our Lord severely rebuked the scribes and Pharisees for their hypocrisy (Matt. 6:2, 5, 16). \"The hypocrite\u0027s hope shall perish\" (Job 8:13). The Hebrew word here rendered \"hypocrite\" rather means the \"godless\" or \"profane,\" as it is rendered in Jer. 23:11, i.e., polluted with crimes."}]}
