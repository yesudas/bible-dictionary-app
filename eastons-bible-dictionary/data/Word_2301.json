{"word":"Lip","sections":[{"paragraph":"Besides its literal sense (Isa. 37:29, etc.), is used in the original (saphah) metaphorically for an edge or border, as of a cup (1 Kings 7:26), a garment (Ex. 28:32), a curtain (26:4), the sea (Gen. 22:17), the Jordan (2 Kings 2:13). To \"open the lips\" is to begin to speak (Job 11:5); to \"refrain the lips\" is to keep silence (Ps. 40:9; 1 Pet. 3:10). The \"fruit of the lips\" (Heb. 13:15) is praise, and the \"calves of the lips\" thank-offerings (Hos. 14:2). To \"shoot out the lip\" is to manifest scorn and defiance (Ps. 22:7). Many similar forms of expression are found in Scripture."}]}
