{"word":"Gilead, Balm of","sections":[{"paragraph":"The region of Gilead abounded in spices and aromatic gums, which were exported to Egypt and Tyre (Gen. 37:25; Jer. 8:22; 46:11; Ezek. 27:17). The word \"balm\" is a contracted form of \"balsam,\" a word derived from the Greek balsamon, which was adopted as the representative of the Hebrew words baal shemen, meaning \"lord\" or \"chief of oils.\""},{"paragraph":"The Hebrew name of this balm was tsori. The tree yielding this medicinal oil was probably the Balsamodendron opobalsamum of botanists, and the Amyris opobalsamum of Linnaeus. It is an evergreen, rising to the height of about 14 feet. The oil or resin, exuding through an orifice made in its bark in very small quantities, is esteemed of great value for its supposed medicinal qualities. (See [241]BALM.) It may be noted that Coverdale\u0027s version reads in Jer. 8:22, \"There is no triacle in Galaad.\" The word \"triacle\" \u003d \"treacle\" is used in the sense of ointment."}]}
