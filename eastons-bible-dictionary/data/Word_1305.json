{"word":"Fallow-deer","sections":[{"paragraph":"Deut. 14:5 (R.V., \"Wild goat\"); 1 Kings 4:23 (R.V., \"roebucks\"). This animal, called in Hebrew yahmur, from a word meaning \"to be red,\" is regarded by some as the common fallow-deer, the Cervus dama, which is said to be found very generally over Western and Southern Asia. It is called \"fallow\" from its pale-red or yellow colour. Some interpreters, however, regard the name as designating the bubale, Antelope bubale, the \"wild cow\" of North Africa, which is about the size of a stag, like the hartebeest of South Africa. A species of deer has been found at Mount Carmel which is called yahmur by the Arabs. It is said to be similar to the European roebuck."}]}
