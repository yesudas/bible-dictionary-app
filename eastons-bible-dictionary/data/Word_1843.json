{"word":"Huldah","sections":[{"paragraph":"Weasel, a prophetess; the wife of Shallum. She was consulted regarding the \"book of the law\" discovered by the high priest Hilkiah (2 Kings 22:14-20; 2 Chr. 34:22-28). She resided in that part of Jerusalem called the Mishneh (A.V., \"the college;\" R.V., \"the second quarter\"), supposed by some to be the suburb between the inner and the outer wall, the second or lower city, Akra. Miriam (Ex. 15:20) and Deborah (Judg. 4:4) are the only others who bear the title of \"prophetess,\" for the word in Isa. 8:3 means only the prophet\u0027s wife."}]}
