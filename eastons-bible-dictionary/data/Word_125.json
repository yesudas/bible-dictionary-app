{"word":"Agrippa I.","sections":[{"paragraph":"The grandson of Herod the Great, and son of Aristobulus and Bernice. The Roman emperor Caligula made him governor first of the territories of Philip, then of the tetrarchy of Lysanias, with the title of king (\"king Herod\"), and finally of that of Antipas, who was banished, and of Samaria and Judea. Thus he became ruler over the whole of Palestine. He was a persecutor of the early Christians. He slew James, and imprisoned Peter (Acts 12:1-4). He died at Caesarea, being \"eaten of worms\" (Acts 12:23), A.D. 44. (Comp. Josephus, Ant. xix. 8.)"}]}
