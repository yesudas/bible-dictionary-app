{"word":"Hiram","sections":[{"paragraph":"High-born. (1.) Generally \"Huram,\" one of the sons of Bela (1 Chr. 8:5)."},{"paragraph":"(2.) Also \"Huram\" and \"Horam,\" king of Tyre. He entered into an alliance with David, and assisted him in building his palace by sending him able workmen, and also cedar-trees and fir-trees from Lebanon (2 Sam. 5:11; 1 Chr. 14:1). After the death of David he entered into a similar alliance with Solomon, and assisted him greatly in building the temple (1 Kings 5:1; 9:11; 2 Chr. 2:3). He also took part in Solomon\u0027s traffic to the Eastern Seas (1 Kings 9:27; 10:11; 2 Chr. 8:18; 9:10)."},{"paragraph":"(3.) The \"master workman\" whom Hiram sent to Solomon. He was the son of a widow of Dan, and of a Tyrian father. In 2 Chr. 2:13 \"Huram my father\" should be Huram Abi, the word \"Abi\" (rendered here \"my father\") being regarded as a proper name, or it may perhaps be a title of distinction given to Huram, and equivalent to \"master.\" (Comp. 1 Kings 7:14; 2 Chr. 4:16.) He cast the magnificent brazen works for Solomon\u0027s temple in clay-beds in the valley of Jordan, between Succoth and Zarthan."}]}
