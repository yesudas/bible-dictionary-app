{"word":"Judgment hall","sections":[{"paragraph":"Gr. praitorion (John 18:28, 33; 19:9; Matt. 27:27), \"common hall.\" In all these passages the Revised Version renders \"palace.\" In Mark 15:16 the word is rendered \"Praetorium\" (q.v.), which is a Latin word, meaning literally the residence of the praetor, and then the governor\u0027s residence in general, though not a praetor. Throughout the Gospels the word \"praitorion\" has this meaning (comp. Acts 23:35). Pilate\u0027s official residence when he was in Jerusalem was probably a part of the fortress of Antonia."},{"paragraph":"The trial of our Lord was carried on in a room or office of the palace. The \"whole band\" spoken of by Mark were gathered together in the palace court."}]}
