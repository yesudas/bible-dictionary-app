A prophet of Shiloh (1 Kings 11:29; 14:2), called the \"Shilonite,\" in the days of Rehoboam. We have on record two of his remarkable prophecies, 1 Kings 11:31-39, announcing the rending of the ten tribes from Solomon; and 1 Kings 14:6-16, delivered to Jeroboam\u0027s wife, foretelling the death of Abijah the king\u0027s son, the destruction of Jeroboam\u0027s house, and the captivity of Israel \"beyond the river.\" Jeroboam bears testimony to the high esteem in which he was held as a prophet of God (1 Kings 14:2, 3)."}]}
