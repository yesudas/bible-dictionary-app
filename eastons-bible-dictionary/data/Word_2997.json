{"word":"Praetorium","sections":[{"paragraph":"The Greek word (praitorion) thus rendered in Mark 15:16 is rendered \"common hall\" (Matt. 27:27, marg., \"governor\u0027s house\"), \"judgment hall,\" (John 18:28, 33, marg., \"Pilate\u0027s house\", 19:9; Acts 23:35), \"palace\" (Phil. 1:13). This is properly a military word. It denotes (1) the general\u0027s tent or headquarters; (2) the governor\u0027s residence, as in Acts 23:35 (R.V., \"palace\"); and (3) the praetorian guard (See [506]PALACE), or the camp or quarters of the praetorian cohorts (Acts 28:16), the imperial guards in immediate attendance on the emperor, who was \"praetor\" or commander-in-chief."}]}
