{"word":"Pan","sections":[{"paragraph":"A vessel of metal or earthenware used in culinary operations; a cooking-pan or frying-pan frequently referred to in the Old Testament (Lev. 2:5; 6:21; Num. 11:8; 1 Sam. 2:14, etc.)."},{"paragraph":"The \"ash-pans\" mentioned in Ex. 27:3 were made of copper, and were used in connection with the altar of burnt-offering. The \"iron pan\" mentioned in Ezek. 4:3 (marg., \"flat plate \" or \"slice\") was probably a mere plate of iron used for baking. The \"fire-pans\" of Ex. 27:3 were fire-shovels used for taking up coals. The same Hebrew word is rendered \"snuff-dishes\" (25:38; 37:23) and \"censers\" (Lev. 10:1; 16:12; Num. 4:14, etc.). These were probably simply metal vessels employed for carrying burning embers from the brazen altar to the altar of incense."},{"paragraph":"The \"frying-pan\" mentioned in Lev. 2:7; 7:9 was a pot for boiling."}]}
