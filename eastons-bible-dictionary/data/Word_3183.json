{"word":"Saint","sections":[{"paragraph":"One separated from the world and consecrated to God; one holy by profession and by covenant; a believer in Christ (Ps. 16:3; Rom. 1:7; 8:27; Phil. 1:1; Heb. 6:10)."},{"paragraph":"The \"saints\" spoken of in Jude 1:14 are probably not the disciples of Christ, but the \"innumerable company of angels\" (Heb. 12:22; Ps. 68:17), with reference to Deut. 33:2."},{"paragraph":"This word is also used of the holy dead (Matt. 27:52; Rev. 18:24). It was not used as a distinctive title of the apostles and evangelists and of a \"spiritual nobility\" till the fourth century. In that sense it is not a scriptural title."}]}
