{"word":"Copper","sections":[{"paragraph":"Derived from the Greek kupros (the island of Cyprus), called \"Cyprian brass,\" occurs only in the Authorized Version in Ezra 8:27. Elsewhere the Hebrew word (nehosheth) is improperly rendered \"brass,\" and sometimes \"steel\" (2 Sam. 22:35; Jer. 15:12). The \"bow of steel\" (Job 20:24; Ps. 18:34) should have been \"bow of copper\" (or \"brass,\" as in the R.V.). The vessels of \"fine copper\" of Ezra 8:27 were probably similar to those of \"bright brass\" mentioned in 1 Kings 7:45; Dan. 10:6."},{"paragraph":"Tubal-cain was the first artificer in brass and iron (Gen. 4:22). Hiram was noted as a worker in brass (1 Kings 7:14). Copper abounded in Palestine (Deut. 8:9; Isa. 60:17; 1 Chr. 22:3, 14). All sorts of vessels in the tabernacle and the temple were made of it (Lev. 6:28; Num. 16:39; 2 Chr. 4:16; Ezra 8:27); also weapons of war (1 Sam. 17:5, 6, 38; 2 Sam. 21:16). Iron is mentioned only four times (Gen. 4:22; Lev. 26:19; Num. 31:22; 35:16) in the first four books of Moses, while copper (rendered \"brass\") is mentioned forty times. (See [126]BRASS.)"},{"paragraph":"We find mention of Alexander (q.v.), a \"coppersmith\" of Ephesus (2 Tim. 4:14)."}]}
