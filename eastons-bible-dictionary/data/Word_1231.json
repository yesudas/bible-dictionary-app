{"word":"Ephraim, Mount","sections":[{"paragraph":"The central mountainous district of Palestine occupied by the tribe of Ephraim (Josh. 17:15; 19:50; 20:7), extending from Bethel to the plain of Jezreel. In Joshua\u0027s time (Josh. 17:18) these hills were densely wooded. They were intersected by well-watered, fertile valleys, referred to in Jer. 50:19. Joshua was buried at Timnath-heres among the mountains of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash (Judg. 2:9). This region is also called the \"mountains of Israel\" (Josh. 11:21) and the \"mountains of Samaria\" (Jer. 31:5, 6: Amos 3:9)."}]}
