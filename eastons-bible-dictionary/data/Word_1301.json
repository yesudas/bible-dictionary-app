{"word":"Fairs","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Heb. izabhonim), found seven times in Ezek. 27, and nowhere else. The Authorized Version renders the word thus in all these instances, except in verse 33, where \"wares\" is used. The Revised Version uniformly renders by \"wares,\" which is the correct rendering of the Hebrew word. It never means \"fairs\" in the modern sense of the word."}]}
