{"word":"Cankerworm","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Heb. yelek), \"the licking locust,\" which licks up the grass of the field; probably the locust at a certain stage of its growth, just as it emerges from the caterpillar state (Joel 1:4; 2:25). The word is rendered \"caterpillar\" in Ps. 105:34; Jer. 51:14, 17 (but R.V. \"canker-worm\"). \"It spoileth and fleeth away\" (Nah. 3:16), or as some read the passage, \"The cankerworm putteth off [i.e., the envelope of its wings], and fleeth away.\""}]}
