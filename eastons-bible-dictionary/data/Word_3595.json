{"word":"Taxing","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Luke 2:2; R.V., \"enrolment\"), \"when Cyrenius was governor of Syria,\" is simply a census of the people, or an enrolment of them with a view to their taxation. The decree for the enrolment was the occasion of Joseph and Mary\u0027s going up to Bethlehem. It has been argued by some that Cyrenius (q.v.) was governor of Cilicia and Syria both at the time of our Lord\u0027s birth and some years afterwards. This decree for the taxing referred to the whole Roman world, and not to Judea alone. (See [624]CENSUS.)"}]}
