{"word":"Plane tree","sections":[{"paragraph":"Heb. armon (Gen. 30:37; Ezek. 31:8), rendered \"chesnut\" in the Authorized Version, but correctly \"plane tree\" in the Revised Version and the LXX. This tree is frequently found in Palestine, both on the coast and in the north. It usually sheds its outer bark, and hence its Hebrew name, which means \"naked.\" (See [497]CHESTNUT.)"}]}
