{"word":"Achor","sections":[{"paragraph":"Trouble, a valley near Jericho, so called in consequence of the trouble which the sin of Achan caused Israel (Josh. 7:24, 26). The expression \"valley of Achor\" probably became proverbial for that which caused trouble, and when Isaiah (Isa. 65:10) refers to it he uses it in this sense: \"The valley of Achor, a place for herds to lie down in;\" i.e., that which had been a source of calamity would become a source of blessing. Hosea also (Hos. 2:15) uses the expression in the same sense: \"The valley of Achor for a door of hope;\" i.e., trouble would be turned into joy, despair into hope. This valley has been identified with the Wady Kelt."}]}
