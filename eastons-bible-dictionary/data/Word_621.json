{"word":"Bonnet","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Heb. peer), Ex. 39:28 (R.V., \"head-tires\"); Ezek. 44:18 (R.V., \"tires\"), denotes properly a turban worn by priests, and in Isa. 3:20 (R.V., \"head-tires\") a head-dress or tiara worn by females. The Hebrew word so rendered literally means an ornament, as in Isa. 61:10 (R.V., \"garland\"), and in Ezek. 24:17, 23 \"tire\" (R.V., \"head-tire\"). It consisted of a piece of cloth twisted about the head. In Ex. 28:40; 29:9 it is the translation of a different Hebrew word (migba\u0027ah), which denotes the turban (R.V., \"head-tire\") of the common priest as distinguished from the mitre of the high priest. (See [72]MITRE.)"}]}
