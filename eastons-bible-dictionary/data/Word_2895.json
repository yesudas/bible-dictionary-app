Balak was more than ever enraged at Balaam, and bade him flee for his life. But before he went he gave expression to that wonderful prediction regarding the future of this mysterious people, whose \"goodly tents\" were spread out before him, and the coming of a \"Star\" out of Jacob and a \"Sceptre\" out of Israel (24:14-17)."},{"paragraph":"(2.)
