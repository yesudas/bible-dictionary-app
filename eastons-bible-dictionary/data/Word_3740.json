{"word":"Ulai","sections":[{"paragraph":"The Eulaus of the Greeks; a river of Susiana. It was probably the eastern branch of the Choasper (Kerkhan), which divided into two branches some 20 miles above the city of Susa. Hence Daniel (8:2, 16) speaks of standing \"between the banks of Ulai\", i.e., between the two streams of the divided river."}]}
