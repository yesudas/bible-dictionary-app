{"word":"Meals","sections":[{"paragraph":"Are at the present day \"eaten from a round table little higher than a stool, guests sitting cross-legged on mats or small carpets in a circle, and dipping their fingers into one large dish heaped with a mixture of boiled rice and other grain and meat. But in the time of our Lord, and perhaps even from the days of Amos (6:4, 7), the foreign custom had been largely introduced of having broad couches, forming three sides of a small square, the guests reclining at ease on their elbows during meals, with their faces to the space within, up and down which servants passed offering various dishes, or in the absence of servants, helping themselves from dishes laid on a table set between the couches.\" Geikie\u0027s Life of Christ. (Comp. Luke 7:36-50.) (See [386]ABRAHAM\u0027S BOSOM; [387]BANQUET; [388]FEAST.)"}]}
