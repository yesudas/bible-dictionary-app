{"word":"Yoke","sections":[{"paragraph":"(1.) Fitted on the neck of oxen for the purpose of binding to them the traces by which they might draw the plough, etc. (Num. 19:2; Deut. 21:3). It was a curved piece of wood called \u0027ol."},{"paragraph":"(2.) In Jer. 27:2; 28:10, 12 the word in the Authorized Version rendered \"yoke\" is motah, which properly means a \"staff,\" or as in the Revised Version, \"bar.\""},{"paragraph":"These words in the Hebrew are both used figuratively of severe bondage, or affliction, or subjection (Lev. 26:13; 1 Kings 12:4; Isa. 47:6; Lam. 1:14; 3:27). In the New Testament the word \"yoke\" is also used to denote servitude (Matt. 11:29, 30; Acts 15:10; Gal. 5:1)."},{"paragraph":"(3.) In 1 Sam. 11:7, 1 Kings 19:21, Job 1:3 the word thus translated is tzemed, which signifies a pair, two oxen yoked or coupled together, and hence in 1 Sam. 14:14 it represents as much land as a yoke of oxen could plough in a day, like the Latin jugum. In Isa. 5:10 this word in the plural is translated \"acres.\""}]}
