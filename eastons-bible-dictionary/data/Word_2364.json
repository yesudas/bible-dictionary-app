{"word":"Magdalene","sections":[{"paragraph":"A surname derived from Magdala, the place of her nativity, given to one of the Marys of the Gospels to distinguish her from the other Marys (Matt. 27:56, 61; 28:1, etc.). A mistaken notion has prevailed that this Mary was a woman of bad character, that she was the woman who is emphatically called \"a sinner\" (Luke 7:36-50). (See [372]MARY.)"}]}
