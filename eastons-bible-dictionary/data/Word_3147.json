{"word":"Robbery","sections":[{"paragraph":"Practised by the Ishmaelites (Gen. 16:12), the Chaldeans and Sabeans (Job 1:15, 17), and the men of Shechem (Judg. 9:25. See also 1 Sam. 27:6-10; 30; Hos. 4:2; 6:9). Robbers infested Judea in our Lord\u0027s time (Luke 10:30; John 18:40; Acts 5:36, 37; 21:38; 2 Cor. 11:26). The words of the Authorized Version, \"counted it not robbery to be equal,\" etc. (Phil. 2:6, 7), are better rendered in the Revised Version, \"counted it not a prize to be on an equality,\" etc., i.e., \"did not look upon equality with God as a prize which must not slip from his grasp\" \u003d \"did not cling with avidity to the prerogatives of his divine majesty; did not ambitiously display his equality with God.\""},{"paragraph":"\"Robbers of churches\" should be rendered, as in the Revised Version, \"of temples.\" In the temple at Ephesus there was a great treasure-chamber, and as all that was laid up there was under the guardianship of the goddess Diana, to steal from such a place would be sacrilege (Acts 19:37)."}]}
