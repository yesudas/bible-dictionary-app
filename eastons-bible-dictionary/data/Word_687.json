{"word":"Cake","sections":[{"paragraph":"Cakes made of wheat or barley were offered in the temple. They were salted, but unleavened (Ex. 29:2; Lev. 2:4). In idolatrous worship thin cakes or wafers were offered \"to the queen of heaven\" (Jer. 7:18; 44:19)."},{"paragraph":"Pancakes are described in 2 Sam. 13:8, 9. Cakes mingled with oil and baked in the oven are mentioned in Lev. 2:4, and \"wafers unleavened anointed with oil,\" in Ex. 29:2; Lev. 8:26; 1 Chr. 23:29. \"Cracknels,\" a kind of crisp cakes, were among the things Jeroboam directed his wife to take with her when she went to consult Ahijah the prophet at Shiloh (1 Kings 14:3). Such hard cakes were carried by the Gibeonites when they came to Joshua (9:5, 12). They described their bread as \"mouldy;\" but the Hebrew word nikuddim, here used, ought rather to be rendered \"hard as biscuit.\" It is rendered \"cracknels\" in 1 Kings 14:3. The ordinary bread, when kept for a few days, became dry and excessively hard. The Gibeonites pointed to this hardness of their bread as an evidence that they had come a long journey."},{"paragraph":"We read also of honey-cakes (Ex. 16:31), \"cakes of figs\" (1 Sam. 25:18), \"cake\" as denoting a whole piece of bread (1 Kings 17:12), and \"a [round] cake of barley bread\" (Judg. 7:13). In Lev. 2 is a list of the different kinds of bread and cakes which were fit for offerings."}]}
