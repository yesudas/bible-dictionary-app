{"word":"Bowl","sections":[{"paragraph":"The sockets of the lamps of the golden candlestick of the tabernacle are called bowls (Ex. 25:31, 33, 34; 37:17, 19, 20); the same word so rendered being elsewhere rendered \"cup\" (Gen. 44:2, 12, 16), and wine \"pot\" (Jer. 35:5). The reservoir for oil, from which pipes led to each lamp in Zechariah\u0027s vision of the candlestick, is called also by this name (Zech. 4:2, 3); so also are the vessels used for libations (Ex. 25:29; 37:16)."}]}
