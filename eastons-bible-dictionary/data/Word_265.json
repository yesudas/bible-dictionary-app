{"word":"Apollos","sections":[{"paragraph":"A Jew \"born at Alexandria,\" a man well versed in the Scriptures and eloquent (Acts 18:24; R.V., \"learned\"). He came to Ephesus (about A.D. 49), where he spake \"boldly\" in the synagogue (18:26), although he did not know as yet that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah. Aquila and Priscilla instructed him more perfectly in \"the way of God\", i.e., in the knowledge of Christ. He then proceeded to Corinth, where he met Paul (Acts 18:27; 19:1). He was there very useful in watering the good seed Paul had sown (1 Cor. 1:12), and in gaining many to Christ. His disciples were much attached to him (1 Cor. 3:4-7, 22). He was with Paul at Ephesus when he wrote the First Epistle to the Corinthians; and Paul makes kindly reference to him in his letter to Titus (3:13). Some have supposed, although without sufficient ground, that he was the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews."}]}
