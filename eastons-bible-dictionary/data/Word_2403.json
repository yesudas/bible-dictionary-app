It seems to have been a stall or crib for feeding cattle. Stables and mangers in our modern sense were in ancient times unknown in the East. The word here properly denotes \"the ledge or projection in the end of the room used as a stall on which the hay or other food of the animals of travellers was placed.\" (See [376]INN.)"}]}
