{"word":"Horn","sections":[{"paragraph":"Trumpets were at first horns perforated at the tip, used for various purposes (Josh. 6:4, 5)."},{"paragraph":"Flasks or vessels were made of horn (1 Sam. 16:1, 13; 1 Kings 1:39)."},{"paragraph":"But the word is used also metaphorically to denote the projecting corners of the altar of burnt offerings (Ex. 27:2) and of incense (30:2). The horns of the altar of burnt offerings were to be smeared with the blood of the slain bullock (29:12; Lev. 4:7-18). The criminal, when his crime was accidental, found an asylum by laying hold of the horns of the altar (1 Kings 1:50; 2:28)."},{"paragraph":"The word also denotes the peak or summit of a hill (Isa. 5:1, where the word \"hill\" is the rendering of the same Hebrew word)."},{"paragraph":"This word is used metaphorically also for strength (Deut. 33:17) and honour (Job 16:15; Lam. 2:3). Horns are emblems of power, dominion, glory, and fierceness, as they are the chief means of attack and defence with the animals endowed with them (Dan. 8:5, 9; 1 Sam. 2:1; 16:1, 13; 1 Kings 1:39; 22:11; Josh. 6:4, 5; Ps. 75:5, 10; 132:17; Luke 1:69, etc.). The expression \"horn of salvation,\" applied to Christ, means a salvation of strength, or a strong Saviour (Luke 1:69). To have the horn \"exalted\" denotes prosperity and triumph (Ps. 89:17, 24). To \"lift up\" the horn is to act proudly (Zech. 1:21)."},{"paragraph":"Horns are also the symbol of royal dignity and power (Jer. 48:25; Zech. 1:18; Dan. 8:24)."}]}
