{"word":"Adummim","sections":[{"paragraph":"The red ones, a place apparently on the road between Jericho and Jerusalem, \"on the south side of the torrent\" Wady Kelt, looking toward Gilgal, mentioned Josh. 15:7; 18:17. It was nearly half-way between Jerusalem and Jericho, and now bears the name of Tal-at-ed-Dumm. It is supposed to have been the place referred to in the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:30-37). Recently a new carriage-road has been completed, and carriages for the first time have come along this road from Jerusalem."}]}
