In Gen. 9:20 \"husbandman\" is literally \"man of the ground or earth.\" Altars were to be built of earth (Ex. 20:24). Naaman asked for two mules\u0027 burden of earth (2 Kings 5:17), under the superstitious notion that Jehovah, like the gods of the heathen, could be acceptably worshipped only on his own soil."},{"paragraph":"(2). As the rendering of \u0027erets, it means the whole world (Gen. 1:2); the land as opposed to the sea (1:10). Erets also denotes a country (21:32); a plot of ground (23:15); the ground on which a man stands (33:3); the inhabitants of the earth (6:1; 11:1); all the world except Israel (2 Chr. 13:9).
