{"word":"Greyhound","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Prov. 30:31), the rendering of the Hebrew zarzir mothnayim, meaning literally \"girded as to the lions.\" Some (Gesen.; R.V. marg.) render it \"war-horse.\" The LXX. and Vulgate versions render it \"cock.\" It has been by some interpreters rendered also \"stag\" and \"warrior,\" as being girded about or panoplied, and \"wrestler.\" The greyhound, however, was evidently known in ancient times, as appears from Egyptian monuments."}]}
