{"word":"Dalmanutha","sections":[{"paragraph":"A place on the west of the Sea of Galilee, mentioned only in Mark 8:10. In the parallel passage it is said that Christ came \"into the borders of Magdala\" (Matt. 15:39). It is plain, then, that Dalmanutha was near Magdala, which was probably the Greek name of one of the many Migdols (i.e., watch-towers) on the western side of the lake of Gennesaret. It has been identified in the ruins of a village about a mile from Magdala, in the little open valley of Ain-el-Barideh, \"the cold fountain,\" called el-Mejdel, possibly the \"Migdal-el\" of Josh. 19:38."}]}
