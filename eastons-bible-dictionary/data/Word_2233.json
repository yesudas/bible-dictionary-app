It has been called \"Lamech\u0027s sword-song.\" He was \"rude and ruffianly,\" fearing neither God nor man. With him the curtain falls on the race of Cain. We know nothing of his descendants."},{"paragraph":"(2.) The seventh in descent from Seth, being the only son of Methuselah. Noah was the oldest of his several sons (Gen. 5:25-31; Luke 3:36)."}]}
