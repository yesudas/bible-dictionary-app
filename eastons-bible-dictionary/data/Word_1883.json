{"word":"Inn","sections":[{"paragraph":"In the modern sense, unknown in the East. The khans or caravanserais, which correspond to the European inn, are not alluded to in the Old Testament. The \"inn\" mentioned in Ex. 4:24 was just the halting-place of the caravan. In later times khans were erected for the accommodation of travellers. In Luke 2:7 the word there so rendered denotes a place for loosing the beasts of their burdens. It is rendered \"guest-chamber\" in Mark 14:14 and Luke 22:11. In Luke 10:34 the word so rendered is different. That inn had an \"inn-keeper,\" who attended to the wants of travellers."}]}
