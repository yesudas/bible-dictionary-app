{"word":"Cup","sections":[{"paragraph":"A wine-cup (Gen. 40:11, 21), various forms of which are found on Assyrian and Egyptian monuments. All Solomon\u0027s drinking vessels were of gold (1 Kings 10: 21). The cups mentioned in the New Testament were made after Roman and Greek models, and were sometimes of gold (Rev. 17:4)."},{"paragraph":"The art of divining by means of a cup was practiced in Egypt (Gen. 44:2-17), and in the East generally."},{"paragraph":"The \"cup of salvation\" (Ps. 116:13) is the cup of thanksgiving for the great salvation. The \"cup of consolation\" (Jer. 16:7) refers to the custom of friends sending viands and wine to console relatives in mourning (Prov. 31:6). In 1 Cor. 10:16, the \"cup of blessing\" is contrasted with the \"cup of devils\" (1 Cor. 10:21). The sacramental cup is the \"cup of blessing,\" because of blessing pronounced over it (Matt. 26:27; Luke 22:17). The \"portion of the cup\" (Ps. 11:6; 16:5) denotes one\u0027s condition of life, prosperous or adverse. A \"cup\" is also a type of sensual allurement (Jer. 51:7; Prov. 23:31; Rev. 17:4). We read also of the \"cup of astonishment,\" the \"cup of trembling,\" and the \"cup of God\u0027s wrath\" (Ps. 75:8; Isa. 51:17; Jer. 25:15; Lam. 4:21; Ezek. 23:32; Rev. 16:19; comp. Matt. 26:39, 42; John 18:11). The cup is also the symbol of death (Matt. 16:28; Mark 9:1; Heb. 2:9)."}]}
