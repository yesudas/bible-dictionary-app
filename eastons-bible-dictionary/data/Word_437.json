{"word":"Baptism, John\u0027s","sections":[{"paragraph":"Was not Christian baptism, nor was that which was practised by the disciples previous to our Lord\u0027s crucifixion. Till then the New Testament economy did not exist. John\u0027s baptism bound its subjects to repentance, and not to the faith of Christ. It was not administered in the name of the Trinity, and those whom John baptized were rebaptized by Paul (Acts 18:24; 19:7)."}]}
