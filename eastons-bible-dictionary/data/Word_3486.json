{"word":"South","sections":[{"paragraph":"Heb. Negeb, that arid district to the south of Palestine through which lay the caravan route from Central Palestine to Egypt (Gen. 12:9; 13:1, 3; 46:1-6). \"The Negeb comprised a considerable but irregularly-shaped tract of country, its main portion stretching from the mountains and lowlands of Judah in the north to the mountains of Azazemeh in the south, and from the Dead Sea and southern Ghoron the east to the Mediterranean on the west.\" In Ezek. 20:46 (21:1 in Heb.) three different Hebrew words are all rendered \"south.\" (1) \"Set thy face toward the south\" (Teman, the region on the right, 1 Sam. 33:24); (2) \"Drop thy word toward the south\" (Negeb, the region of dryness, Josh. 15:4); (3) \"Prophesy against the forest of the south field\" (Darom, the region of brightness, Deut. 33:23). In Job 37:9 the word \"south\" is literally \"chamber,\" used here in the sense of treasury (comp. 38:22; Ps. 135:7). This verse is rendered in the Revised Version \"out of the chamber of the south.\""}]}
