{"word":"Rose","sections":[{"paragraph":"Many varieties of the rose proper are indigenous to Syria. The famed rose of Damascus is white, but there are also red and yellow roses. In Cant. 2:1 and Isa. 35:1 the Hebrew word habatstseleth (found only in these passages), rendered \"rose\" (R.V. marg., \"autumn crocus\"), is supposed by some to mean the oleander, by others the sweet-scented narcissus (a native of Palestine), the tulip, or the daisy; but nothing definite can be affirmed regarding it."},{"paragraph":"The \"rose of Sharon\" is probably the cistus or rock-rose, several species of which abound in Palestine. \"Mount Carmel especially abounds in the cistus, which in April covers some of the barer parts of the mountain with a glow not inferior to that of the Scottish heather.\" (See [539]MYRRH [2].)"}]}
