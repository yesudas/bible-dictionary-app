{"word":"Jaw-bone","sections":[{"paragraph":"Of an ass afforded Samson a weapon for the great slaughter of the Philistines (Judg. 15:15), in which he slew a thousand men. In verse 19 the Authorized Version reads, \"God clave a hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout.\" This is a mis-translation of the words. The rendering should be as in the Revised Version, \"God clave the hollow place that is in Lehi,\" etc., Lehi (q.v.) being the name of the hill where this conflict was waged, possibly so called because it was in shape like a jaw-bone."}]}
