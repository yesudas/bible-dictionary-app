{"word":"Suph","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Deut. 1:1, R.V.; marg., \"some ancient versions have the Red Sea,\" as in the A.V.). Some identify it with Suphah (Num. 21:14, marg., A.V.) as probably the name of a place. Others identify it with es-Sufah \u003d Maaleh-acrabbim (Josh. 15:3), and others again with Zuph (1 Sam. 9:5). It is most probable, however, that, in accordance with the ancient versions, this word is to be regarded as simply an abbreviation of Yam-suph, i.e., the \"Red Sea.\""}]}
