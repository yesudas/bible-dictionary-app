{"word":"Mouldy","sections":[{"paragraph":"Of the Gibeonites it is said that \"all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy\" (Josh. 9:5, 12). The Hebrew word here rendered \"mouldy\" (nikuddim) is rendered \"cracknels\" in 1 Kings 14:3, and denotes a kind of crisp cake. The meaning is that the bread of the Gibeonites had become dry and hard, hard as biscuits, and thus was an evidence of the length of the journey they had travelled."}]}
