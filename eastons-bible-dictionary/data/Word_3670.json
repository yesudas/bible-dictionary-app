{"word":"Timothy, Second Epistle to","sections":[{"paragraph":"Was probably written a year or so after the first, and from Rome, where Paul was for a second time a prisoner, and was sent to Timothy by the hands of Tychicus. In it he entreats Timothy to come to him before winter, and to bring Mark with him (comp. Phil. 2:22). He was anticipating that \"the time of his departure was at hand\" (2 Tim. 4:6), and he exhorts his \"son Timothy\" to all diligence and steadfastness, and to patience under persecution (1:6-15), and to a faithful discharge of all the duties of his office (4:1-5), with all the solemnity of one who was about to appear before the Judge of quick and dead."}]}
