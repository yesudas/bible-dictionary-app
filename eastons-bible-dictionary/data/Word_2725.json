{"word":"Nicolaitanes","sections":[{"paragraph":"The church at Ephesus (Rev. 2:6) is commended for hating the \"deeds\" of the Nicolaitanes, and the church of Pergamos is blamed for having them who hold their \"doctrines\" (15). They were seemingly a class of professing Christians, who sought to introduce into the church a false freedom or licentiousness, thus abusing Paul\u0027s doctrine of grace (comp. 2 Pet. 2:15, 16, 19), and were probably identical with those who held the doctrine of Baalam (q.v.), Rev. 2:14."}]}
