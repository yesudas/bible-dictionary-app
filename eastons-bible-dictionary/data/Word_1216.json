{"word":"Ensign","sections":[{"paragraph":"(1.) Heb. oth, a military standard, especially of a single tribe (Num. 2:2). Each separate tribe had its own \"sign\" or \"ensign.\""},{"paragraph":"(2.) Heb. nes, a lofty signal, as a column or high pole (Num. 21:8, 9); a standard or signal or flag placed on high mountains to point out to the people a place of rendezvous on the irruption of an enemy (Isa. 5:26; 11:12; 18:3; 62:10; Jer. 4:6, 21; Ps. 60:4). This was an occasional signal, and not a military standard. Elevation and conspicuity are implied in the word."},{"paragraph":"(3.) The Hebrew word degel denotes the standard given to each of the four divisions of the host of the Israelites at the Exodus (Num. 1:52; 2:2; 10:14). In Cant. 2:4 it is rendered \"banner.\" We have no definite information as to the nature of these military standards. (See [189]BANNER.)"}]}
