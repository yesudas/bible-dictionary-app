{"word":"Gnat","sections":[{"paragraph":"Only in Matt. 23:24, a small two-winged stinging fly of the genus Culex, which includes mosquitoes. Our Lord alludes here to the gnat in a proverbial expression probably in common use, \"who strain out the gnat;\" the words in the Authorized Version, \"strain at a gnat,\" being a mere typographical error, which has been corrected in the Revised Version. The custom of filtering wine for this purpose was common among the Jews. It was founded on Lev. 11:23. It is supposed that the \"lice,\" Ex. 8:16 (marg. R.V., \"sand-flies\"), were a species of gnat."}]}
