{"word":"Word, The","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Gr. Logos), one of the titles of our Lord, found only in the writings of John (John 1:1-14; 1 John 1:1; Rev. 19:13). As such, Christ is the revealer of God. His office is to make God known. \"No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him\" (John 1:18). This title designates the divine nature of Christ. As the Word, he \"was in the beginning\" and \"became flesh.\" \"The Word was with God \" and \"was God,\" and was the Creator of all things (comp. Ps. 33: 6; 107:20; 119:89; 147:18; Isa. 40:8)."}]}
