{"word":"Tradition","sections":[{"paragraph":"Any kind of teaching, written or spoken, handed down from generation to generation. In Mark 7:3, 9, 13, Col. 2:8, this word refers to the arbitrary interpretations of the Jews. In 2 Thess. 2:15; 3:6, it is used in a good sense. Peter (1 Pet. 1:18) uses this word with reference to the degenerate Judaism of the \"strangers scattered\" whom he addresses (comp. Acts 15:10; Matt. 15:2-6; Gal. 1:14)."}]}
