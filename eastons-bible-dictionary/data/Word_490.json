{"word":"Beaten gold","sections":[{"paragraph":"In Num. 8:4, means \"turned\" or rounded work in gold. The Greek Version, however, renders the word \"solid gold;\" the Revised Version, \"beaten work of gold.\" In 1 Kings 10:16, 17, it probably means \"mixed\" gold, as the word ought to be rendered, i.e., not pure gold. Others render the word in these places \"thin plates of gold.\""}]}
