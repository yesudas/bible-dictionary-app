{"word":"Cockle","sections":[{"paragraph":"Occurs only in Job 31:40 (marg., \"noisome weeds\"), where it is the rendering of a Hebrew word (b\u0027oshah) which means \"offensive,\" \"having a bad smell,\" referring to some weed perhaps which has an unpleasant odour. Or it may be regarded as simply any noisome weed, such as the \"tares\" or darnel of Matt. 13:30. In Isa. 5:2, 4 the plural form is rendered \"wild grapes.\""}]}
