{"word":"Ligure","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Heb. leshem) occurs only in Ex. 28:19 and 39:12, as the name of a stone in the third row on the high priest\u0027s breastplate. Some have supposed that this stone was the same as the jacinth (q.v.), others that it was the opal. There is now no mineral bearing this name. The \"ligurite\" is so named from Liguria in Italy, where it was found."}]}
