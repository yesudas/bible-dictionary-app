{"word":"Gospel","sections":[{"paragraph":"A word of Anglo-Saxon origin, and meaning \"God\u0027s spell\", i.e., word of God, or rather, according to others, \"good spell\", i.e., good news. It is the rendering of the Greek evangelion, i.e., \"good message.\" It denotes (1) \"the welcome intelligence of salvation to man as preached by our Lord and his followers. (2.) It was afterwards transitively applied to each of the four histories of our Lord\u0027s life, published by those who are therefore called Evangelists\u0027, writers of the history of the gospel (the evangelion). (3.) The term is often used to express collectively the gospel doctrines; and preaching the gospel\u0027 is often used to include not only the proclaiming of the good tidings, but the teaching men how to avail themselves of the offer of salvation, the declaring of all the truths, precepts, promises, and threatenings of Christianity.\" It is termed \"the gospel of the grace of God\" (Acts 20:24), \"the gospel of the kingdom\" (Matt. 4:23), \"the gospel of Christ\" (Rom. 1:16), \"the gospel of peace (Eph. 6:15), \"the glorious gospel,\" \"the everlasting gospel,\" \"the gospel of salvation\" (Eph. 1:13)."}]}
