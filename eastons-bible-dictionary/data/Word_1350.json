{"word":"Flagon","sections":[{"paragraph":"Heb. ashishah, (2 Sam. 6:19; 1 Chr. 16:3; Cant. 2:5; Hos. 3:1), meaning properly \"a cake of pressed raisins.\" \"Flagons of wine\" of the Authorized Version should be, as in the Revised Version, \"cakes of raisins\" in all these passages. In Isa. 22:24 it is the rendering of the Hebrew nebel, which properly means a bottle or vessel of skin. (Comp. 1 Sam. 1:24; 10:3; 25:18; 2 Sam. 16:1, where the same Hebrew word is used.)"}]}
