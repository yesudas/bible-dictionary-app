In the valley under Zerin there are two considerable springs, one of which, perhaps that here referred to, \"flows from under a sort of cavern in the wall of conglomerate rock which here forms the base of Gilboa. The water is excellent; and issuing from crevices in the rocks, it spreads out at once into a fine limpid pool forty or fifty feet in diameter, full of fish\" (Robinson). This may be identical with the \"well of Harod\" (Judg. 7:1; comp. 2 Sam. 23:25), probably the Ain Jalud, i.e., the \"spring of Goliath.\""}]}
