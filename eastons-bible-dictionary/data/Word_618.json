{"word":"Bolster","sections":[{"paragraph":"The Hebrew word kebir, rendered \"pillow\" in 1 Sam. 19:13, 16, but in Revised Version marg. \"quilt\" or \"network,\" probably means some counterpane or veil intended to protect the head of the sleeper. A different Hebrew word (meraashoth\u0027) is used for \"bolster\" (1 Sam. 26:7, 11, 16). It is rightly rendered in Revised Version \"at his head.\" In Gen. 28:11, 18 the Authorized Version renders it \"for his pillows,\" and the Revised Version \"under his head.\" In Ezek. 13:18, 20 another Hebrew word (kesathoth) is used, properly denoting \"cushions\" or \"pillows,\" as so rendered both in the Authorized and the Revised Version."}]}
