{"word":"Zaphnath-paaneah","sections":[{"paragraph":"The name which Pharaoh gave to Joseph when he raised him to the rank of prime minister or grand vizier of the kingdom (Gen. 41:45). This is a pure Egyptian word, and has been variously explained. Some think it means \"creator,\" or \"preserver of life.\" Brugsch interprets it as \"governor of the district of the place of life\", i.e., of Goshen, the chief city of which was Pithom, \"the place of life.\" Others explain it as meaning \"a revealer of secrets,\" or \"the man to whom secrets are revealed.\""}]}
