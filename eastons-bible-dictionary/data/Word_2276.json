{"word":"Leviathan","sections":[{"paragraph":"A transliterated Hebrew word (livyathan), meaning \"twisted,\" \"coiled.\" In Job 3:8, Revised Version, and marg. of Authorized Version, it denotes the dragon which, according to Eastern tradition, is an enemy of light; in 41:1 the crocodile is meant; in Ps. 104:26 it \"denotes any large animal that moves by writhing or wriggling the body, the whale, the monsters of the deep.\" This word is also used figuratively for a cruel enemy, as some think \"the Egyptian host, crushed by the divine power, and cast on the shores of the Red Sea\" (Ps. 74:14). As used in Isa. 27:1, \"leviathan the piercing [R.V. swift\u0027] serpent, even leviathan that crooked [R.V. marg. winding\u0027] serpent,\" the word may probably denote the two empires, the Assyrian and the Babylonian."}]}
