{"word":"Obadiah","sections":[{"paragraph":"Servant of the Lord. (1.) An Israelite who was chief in the household of King Ahab (1 Kings 18:3). Amid great spiritual degeneracy he maintained his fidelity to God, and interposed to protect The Lord\u0027s prophets, an hundred of whom he hid at great personal risk in a cave (4, 13). Ahab seems to have held Obadiah in great honour, although he had no sympathy with his piety (5, 6, 7). The last notice of him is his bringing back tidings to Ahab that Elijah, whom he had so long sought for, was at hand (9-16). \"Go,\" said Elijah to him, when he met him in the way, \"go tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.\""},{"paragraph":"(2.)
