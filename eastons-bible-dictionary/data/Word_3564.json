{"word":"Tabor","sections":[{"paragraph":"A height. (1.) Now Jebel et-Tur, a cone-like prominent mountain, 11 miles west of the Sea of Galilee. It is about 1,843 feet high. The view from the summit of it is said to be singularly extensive and grand. This is alluded to in Ps. 89:12; Jer. 46:18. It was here that Barak encamped before the battle with Sisera (q.v.) Judg. 4:6-14. There is an old tradition, which, however, is unfounded, that it was the scene of the transfiguration of our Lord. (See [619]HERMON.) \"The prominence and isolation of Tabor, standing, as it does, on the border-land between the northern and southern tribes, between the mountains and the central plain, made it a place of note in all ages, and evidently led the psalmist to associate it with Hermon, the one emblematic of the south, the other of the north.\" There are some who still hold that this was the scene of the transfiguration (q.v.)."},{"paragraph":"(2.) A town of Zebulum (1 Chr. 6:77)."},{"paragraph":"(3.) The \"plain of Tabor\" (1 Sam. 10:3) should be, as in the Revised Version, \"the oak of Tabor.\" This was probably the Allon-bachuth of Gen. 35:8."}]}
