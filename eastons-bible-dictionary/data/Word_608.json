{"word":"Blood","sections":[{"paragraph":"(1.) As food, prohibited in Gen. 9:4, where the use of animal food is first allowed. Comp. Deut. 12:23; Lev. 3:17; 7:26; 17:10-14. The injunction to abstain from blood is renewed in the decree of the council of Jerusalem (Acts 15:29). It has been held by some, and we think correctly, that this law of prohibition was only ceremonial and temporary; while others regard it as still binding on all. Blood was eaten by the Israelites after the battle of Gilboa (1 Sam. 14:32-34)."},{"paragraph":"(2.) The blood of sacrifices was caught by the priest in a basin, and then sprinkled seven times on the altar; that of the passover on the doorposts and lintels of the houses (Ex. 12; Lev. 4:5-7; 16:14-19). At the giving of the law (Ex. 24:8) the blood of the sacrifices was sprinkled on the people as well as on the altar, and thus the people were consecrated to God, or entered into covenant with him, hence the blood of the covenant (Matt. 26:28; Heb. 9:19, 20; 10:29; 13:20)."},{"paragraph":"(3.) Human blood. The murderer was to be punished (Gen. 9:5). The blood of the murdered \"crieth for vengeance\" (Gen. 4:10). The \"avenger of blood\" was the nearest relative of the murdered, and he was required to avenge his death (Num. 35:24, 27). No satisfaction could be made for the guilt of murder (Num. 35:31)."},{"paragraph":"(4.) Blood used metaphorically to denote race (Acts 17:26), and as a symbol of slaughter (Isa. 34:3). To \"wash the feet in blood\" means to gain a great victory (Ps. 58:10). Wine, from its red colour, is called \"the blood of the grape\" (Gen. 49:11). Blood and water issued from our Saviour\u0027s side when it was pierced by the Roman soldier (John 19:34). This has led pathologists to the conclusion that the proper cause of Christ\u0027s death was rupture of the heart. (Comp. Ps. 69:20.)"}]}
