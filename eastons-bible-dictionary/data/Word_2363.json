{"word":"Magdala","sections":[{"paragraph":"A tower, a town in Galilee, mentioned only in Matt. 15:39. In the parallel passage in Mark 8:10 this place is called Dalmanutha. It was the birthplace of Mary called the Magdalen, or Mary Magdalene. It was on the west shore of the Lake of Tiberias, and is now probably the small obscure village called el-Mejdel, about 3 miles north-west of Tiberias. In the Talmud this city is called \"the city of colour,\" and a particular district of it was called \"the tower of dyers.\" The indigo plant was much cultivated here."}]}
