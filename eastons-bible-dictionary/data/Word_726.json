{"word":"Carnal","sections":[{"paragraph":"Unconverted men are so called (1 Cor. 3:3). They are represented as of a \"carnal mind, which is enmity against God\" (Rom. 8:6, 7). Enjoyments that minister to the wants and desires of man\u0027s animal nature are so called (Rom. 15:27; 1 Cor. 9:11). The ceremonial of the Mosaic law is spoken of as \"carnal,\" because it related to things outward, the bodies of men and of animals, and the purification of the flesh (Heb. 7:16; 9:10). The weapons of Christian warfare are \"not carnal\", that is, they are not of man\u0027s device, nor are wielded by human power (2 Cor. 10:4)."}]}
