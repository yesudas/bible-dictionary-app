{"word":"East","sections":[{"paragraph":"(1.) The orient (mizrah); the rising of the sun. Thus \"the east country\" is the country lying to the east of Syria, the Elymais (Zech. 8:7)."},{"paragraph":"(2). Properly what is in front of one, or a country that is before or in front of another; the rendering of the word kedem. In pointing out the quarters, a Hebrew always looked with his face toward the east. The word kedem is used when the four quarters of the world are described (Gen. 13:14; 28:14); and mizrah when the east only is distinguished from the west (Josh. 11:3; Ps. 50:1; 103:12, etc.). In Gen. 25:6 \"eastward\" is literally \"unto the land of kedem;\" i.e., the lands lying east of Palestine, namely, Arabia, Mesopotamia, etc."}]}
