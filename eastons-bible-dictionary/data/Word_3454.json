{"word":"Sitting","sections":[{"paragraph":"The attitude generally assumed in Palestine by those who were engaged in any kind of work. \"The carpenter saws, planes, and hews with his hand-adze, sitting on the ground or upon the plank he is planning. The washerwoman sits by the tub; and, in a word, no one stands when it is possible to sit. Shopkeepers always sit, and Levi sitting at the receipt of custom (Matt. 9:9) is the exact way to state the case.\", Thomson, Land and Book."}]}
