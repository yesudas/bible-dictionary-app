{"word":"Dial","sections":[{"paragraph":"For the measurement of time, only once mentioned in the Bible, erected by Ahaz (2 Kings 20:11; Isa. 38:8). The Hebrew word (ma\u0027aloth) is rendered \"steps\" in Ex. 20:26, 1 Kings 10:19, and \"degrees\" in 2 Kings 20:9, 10, 11. The ma\u0027aloth was probably stairs on which the shadow of a column or obelisk placed on the top fell. The shadow would cover a greater or smaller number of steps, according as the sun was low or high."},{"paragraph":"Probably the sun-dial was a Babylonian invention. Daniel at Babylon (Dan. 3:6) is the first to make mention of the \"hour.\""}]}
