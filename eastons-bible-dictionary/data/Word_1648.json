{"word":"Harosheth of the Gentiles","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Judg. 4:2) or nations, a city near Hazor in Galilee of the Gentiles, or Upper Galilee, in the north of Palestine. It was here that Jabin\u0027s great army was marshalled before it went forth into the great battlefield of Esdraelon to encounter the army of Israel, by which it was routed and put to flight (Judg. 4). It was situated \"at the entrance of the pass to Esdraelon from the plain of Acre\" at the base of Carmel. The name in the Hebrew is Harosheth ha Gojim, i.e., \"the smithy of the nations;\" probably, as is supposed, so called because here Jabin\u0027s iron war-chariots, armed with scythes, were made. It is identified with el-Harithiyeh."}]}
