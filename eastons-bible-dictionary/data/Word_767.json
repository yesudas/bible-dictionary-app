{"word":"Chance","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Luke 10:31). \"It was not by chance that the priest came down by that road at that time, but by a specific arrangement and in exact fulfilment of a plan; not the plan of the priest, nor the plan of the wounded traveller, but the plan of God. By coincidence (Gr. sungkuria) the priest came down, that is, by the conjunction of two things, in fact, which were previously constituted a pair in the providence of God. In the result they fell together according to the omniscient Designer\u0027s plan. This is the true theory of the divine government.\" Compare the meeting of Philip with the Ethiopian (Acts 8:26, 27). There is no \"chance\" in God\u0027s empire. \"Chance\" is only another word for our want of knowledge as to the way in which one event falls in with another (1 Sam. 6:9; Eccl. 9:11)."}]}
