{"word":"Michtam","sections":[{"paragraph":"Writing; i.e., a poem or song found in the titles of Ps. 16; 56-60. Some translate the word \"golden\", i.e., precious. It is rendered in the LXX. by a word meaning \"tablet inscription\" or a \"stelograph.\" The root of the word means to stamp or grave, and hence it is regarded as denoting a composition so precious as to be worthy to be engraven on a durable tablet for preservation; or, as others render, \"a psalm precious as stamped gold,\" from the word kethem, \"fine or stamped gold.\""}]}
