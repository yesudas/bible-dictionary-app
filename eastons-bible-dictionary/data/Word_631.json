{"word":"Bow","sections":[{"paragraph":"The bow was in use in early times both in war and in the chase (Gen. 21:20; 27:3; 48:22). The tribe of Benjamin were famous for the use of the bow (1 Chr. 8:40; 12:2; 2 Chr. 14:8; 17:17); so also were the Elamites (Isa. 22:6) and the Lydians (Jer. 46:9). The Hebrew word commonly used for bow means properly to tread (1 Chr. 5:18; 8:40), and hence it is concluded that the foot was employed in bending the bow. Bows of steel (correctly \"copper\") are mentioned (2 Sam. 22:35; Ps. 18:34)."},{"paragraph":"The arrows were carried in a quiver (Gen. 27:3; Isa. 22:6; 49:2; Ps. 127:5). They were apparently sometimes shot with some burning material attached to them (Ps. 120:4)."},{"paragraph":"The bow is a symbol of victory (Ps. 7:12). It denotes also falsehood, deceit (Ps. 64:3, 4; Hos. 7:16; Jer. 9:3)."},{"paragraph":"\"The use of the bow\" in 2 Sam. 1:18 (A.V.) ought to be \"the song of the bow,\" as in the Revised Version."}]}
