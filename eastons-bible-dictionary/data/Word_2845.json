{"word":"Paran","sections":[{"paragraph":"Abounding in foliage, or abounding in caverns, (Gen. 21:21), a desert tract forming the north-eastern division of the peninsula of Sinai, lying between the Arabah on the east and the wilderness of Shur on the west. It is intersected in a north-western direction by the Wady el-Arish. It bears the modern name of Badiet et-Tih, i.e., \"the desert of the wanderings.\" This district, through which the children of Israel wandered, lay three days\u0027 march from Sinai (Num. 10:12, 33). From Kadesh, in this wilderness, spies (q.v.) were sent to spy the land (13:3, 26). Here, long afterwards, David found refuge from Saul (1 Sam. 25:1, 4)."}]}
