{"word":"Seer","sections":[{"paragraph":"A name sometimes applied to the prophets because of the visions granted to them. It is first found in 1 Sam. 9:9. It is afterwards applied to Zadok, Gad, etc. (2 Sam. 15:27; 24:11; 1 Chr. 9:22; 25:5; 2 Chr. 9:29; Amos 7:12; Micah 3:7). The \"sayings of the seers\" (2 Chr. 33:18, 19) is rendered in the Revised Version \"the history of Hozai\" (marg., the seers; so the LXX.), of whom, however, nothing is known. (See [563]PROPHET.)"}]}
