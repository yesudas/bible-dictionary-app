{"word":"Ramath of the south","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Heb. Ramath-negeb). The Heb. negeb is the general designation for south or south-west of Judah. This was one of the towns of Simeon (Josh. 19:8). It is the same as \"south Ramoth\" (1 Sam. 30:27; R.V., \"Ramoth of the south\"). Its site is doubtful. Some have thought it another name for Baalath-beer."}]}
