{"word":"Window","sections":[{"paragraph":"Properly only an opening in a house for the admission of light and air, covered with lattice-work, which might be opened or closed (2 Kings 1:2; Acts 20:9). The spies in Jericho and Paul at Damascus were let down from the windows of houses abutting on the town wall (Josh. 2:15; 2 Cor. 11:33). The clouds are metaphorically called the \"windows of heaven\" (Gen. 7:11; Mal. 3:10). The word thus rendered in Isa. 54:12 ought rather to be rendered \"battlements\" (LXX., \"bulwarks;\" R.V., \"pinnacles\"), or as Gesenius renders it, \"notched battlements, i.e., suns or rays of the sun\"\u003d having a radiated appearance like the sun."}]}
