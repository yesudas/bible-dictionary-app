{"word":"Irha-heres","sections":[{"paragraph":"According to some MSS., meaning \"city of destruction.\" Other MSS. read \u0027Irhahares; rendered \"city of the sun\", Isa. 19:18, where alone the word occurs. This name may probably refer to Heliopolis. The prophecy here points to a time when the Jews would so increase in number there as that the city would fall under their influence. This might be in the time of the Ptolemies. (See [295]ON.)"}]}
