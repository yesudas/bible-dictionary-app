{"word":"Judah upon Jordan","sections":[{"paragraph":"The Authorized Version, following the Vulgate, has this rendering in Josh. 19:34. It has been suggested that, following the Masoretic punctuation, the expression should read thus, \"and Judah; the Jordan was toward the sun-rising.\" The sixty cities (Havoth-jair, Num. 32:41) on the east of Jordan were reckoned as belonging to Judah, because Jair, their founder, was a Manassite only on his mother\u0027s side, but on his father\u0027s side of the tribe of Judah (1 Chr. 2:5, 21-23)."}]}
