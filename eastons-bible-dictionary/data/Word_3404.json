{"word":"Shoe","sections":[{"paragraph":"Of various forms, from the mere sandal (q.v.) to the complete covering of the foot. The word so rendered (A.V.) in Deut. 33:25, min\u0027al, \"a bar,\" is derived from a root meaning \"to bolt\" or \"shut fast,\" and hence a fastness or fortress. The verse has accordingly been rendered \"iron and brass shall be thy fortress,\" or, as in the Revised Version, \"thy bars [marg., \"shoes\"] shall be iron and brass.\""}]}
