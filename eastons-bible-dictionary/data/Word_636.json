{"word":"Box-tree","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Heb. teashshur), mentioned in Isa. 60:13; 41:19, was, according to some, a species of cedar growing in Lebanon. The words of Ezek. 27:6 literally translated are, \"Thy benches they have made of ivory, the daughter of the ashur tree,\" i.e., inlaid with ashur wood. The ashur is the box-tree, and accordingly the Revised Version rightly reads \"inlaid in box wood.\" This is the Buxus sempervirens of botanists. It is remarkable for the beauty of its evergreen foliage and for the utility of its hard and durable wood."}]}
