{"word":"Coat","sections":[{"paragraph":"The tunic worn like the shirt next the skin (Lev. 16:4; Cant. 5:3; 2 Sam. 15:32; Ex. 28:4; 29:5). The \"coats of skins\" prepared by God for Adam and Eve were probably nothing more than aprons (Gen. 3:21). This tunic was sometimes woven entire without a seam (John 19:23); it was also sometimes of \"many colours\" (Gen. 37:3; R.V. marg., \"a long garment with sleeves\"). The \"fisher\u0027s coat\" of John 21:7 was obviously an outer garment or cloak, as was also the \"coat\" made by Hannah for Samuel (1 Sam. 2:19). (See [120]DRESS.)"}]}
