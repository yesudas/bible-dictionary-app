{"word":"Uzziah","sections":[{"paragraph":"A contracted form of Azari\u0027ah the Lord is my strength. (1.) One of Amaziah\u0027s sons, whom the people made king of Judah in his father\u0027s stead (2 Kings 14:21; 2 Chr. 26:1). His long reign of about fifty-two years was \"the most prosperous excepting that of Jehosaphat since the time of Solomon.\" He was a vigorous and able ruler, and \"his name spread abroad, even to the entering in of Egypt\" (2 Chr. 26:8, 14). In the earlier part of his reign, under the influence of Zechariah, he was faithful to Jehovah, and \"did that which was right in the sight of the Lord\" (2 Kings 15:3; 2 Chr. 26:4, 5); but toward the close of his long life \"his heart was lifted up to his destruction,\" and he wantonly invaded the priest\u0027s office (2 Chr. 26:16), and entering the sanctuary proceeded to offer incense on the golden altar. Azariah the high priest saw the tendency of such a daring act on the part of the king, and with a band of eighty priests he withstood him (2 Chr. 26:17), saying, \"It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense.\" Uzziah was suddenly struck with leprosy while in the act of offering incense (26:19-21), and he was driven from the temple and compelled to reside in \"a several house\" to the day of his death (2 Kings 15:5, 27; 2 Chr. 26:3). He was buried in a separate grave \"in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings\" (2 Kings 15:7; 2 Chr. 26:23). \"That lonely grave in the royal necropolis would eloquently testify to coming generations that all earthly monarchy must bow before the inviolable order of the divine will, and that no interference could be tolerated with that unfolding of the purposes of God, which, in the fulness of time, would reveal the Christ, the true High Priest and King for evermore\" (Dr. Green\u0027s Kingdom of Israel, etc.)."},{"paragraph":"(2.)
