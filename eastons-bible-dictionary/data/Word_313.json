{"word":"Armenia","sections":[{"paragraph":"High land, occurs only in Authorized Version, 2 Kings 19:37; in Revised Version, \"Ararat,\" which is the Hebrew word. A country in western Asia lying between the Caspian and the Black Sea. Here the ark of Noah rested after the Deluge (Gen. 8:4). It is for the most part high table-land, and is watered by the Aras, the Kur, the Euphrates, and the Tigris. Ararat was properly the name of a part of ancient Armenia. Three provinces of Armenia are mentioned in Jer. 51:27, Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz. Some, however, think Minni a contraction for Armenia. (See [30]ARARAT.)"}]}
