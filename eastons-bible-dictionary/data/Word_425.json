{"word":"Balance","sections":[{"paragraph":"Occurs in Lev. 19:36 and Isa. 46:6, as the rendering of the Hebrew kanch\u0027, which properly means \"a reed\" or \"a cane,\" then a rod or beam of a balance. This same word is translated \"measuring reed\" in Ezek. 40:3, 5; 42:16-18. There is another Hebrew word, mozena\u0027yim, i.e., \"two poisers\", also so rendered (Dan. 5:27). The balances as represented on the most ancient Egyptian monuments resemble those now in use. A \"pair of balances\" is a symbol of justice and fair dealing (Job 31:6; Ps. 62:9; Prov. 11:1). The expression denotes great want and scarcity in Rev. 6:5."}]}
