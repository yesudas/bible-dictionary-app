{"word":"Mantle","sections":[{"paragraph":"(1.) Heb. addereth, a large over-garment. This word is used of Elijah\u0027s mantle (1 Kings 19:13, 19; 2 Kings 2:8, 13, etc.), which was probably a sheepskin. It appears to have been his only garment, a strip of skin or leather binding it to his loins. \u0027Addereth twice occurs with the epithet \"hairy\" (Gen. 25:25; Zech. 13:4, R.V.). It is the word denoting the \"goodly Babylonish garment\" which Achan coveted (Josh. 7:21)."},{"paragraph":"(2.) Heb. me\u0027il, frequently applied to the \"robe of the ephod\" (Ex. 28:4, 31; Lev. 8:7), which was a splendid under tunic wholly of blue, reaching to below the knees. It was woven without seam, and was put on by being drawn over the head. It was worn not only by priests but by kings (1 Sam. 24:4), prophets (15:27), and rich men (Job 1:20; 2:12). This was the \"little coat\" which Samuel\u0027s mother brought to him from year to year to Shiloh (1 Sam. 2:19), a miniature of the official priestly robe."},{"paragraph":"(3.) Semikah, \"a rug,\" the garment which Jael threw as a covering over Sisera (Judg. 4:18). The Hebrew word occurs nowhere else in Scripture."},{"paragraph":"(4.) Maataphoth, plural, only in Isa. 3:22, denoting a large exterior tunic worn by females. (See [378]DRESS.)"}]}
