{"word":"Clement","sections":[{"paragraph":"Mild, a Christian of Philippi, Paul\u0027s \"fellow-labourer,\" whose name he mentions as \"in the book of life\" (Phil. 4:3). It was an opinion of ancient writers that he was the Clement of Rome whose name is well known in church history, and that he was the author of an Epistle to the Corinthians, the only known manuscript of which is appended to the Alexandrian Codex, now in the British Museum. It is of some historical interest, and has given rise to much discussion among critics. It makes distinct reference to Paul\u0027s First Epistle to the Corinthians."}]}
