{"word":"Holiness","sections":[{"paragraph":"In the highest sense belongs to God (Isa. 6:3; Rev. 15:4), and to Christians as consecrated to God\u0027s service, and in so far as they are conformed in all things to the will of God (Rom. 6:19, 22; Eph. 1:4; Titus 1:8; 1 Pet. 1:15). Personal holiness is a work of gradual development. It is carried on under many hindrances, hence the frequent admonitions to watchfulness, prayer, and perseverance (1 Cor. 1:30; 2 Cor. 7:1; Eph. 4:23, 24). (See [280]SANCTIFICATION.)"}]}
