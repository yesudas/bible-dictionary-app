{"word":"Axe","sections":[{"paragraph":"Used in the Authorized Version of Deut. 19:5; 20:19; 1 Kings 6:7, as the translation of a Hebrew word which means \"chopping.\" It was used for felling trees (Isa. 10:34) and hewing timber for building. It is the rendering of a different word in Judg. 9:48, 1 Sam. 13:20, 21, Ps. 74:5, which refers to its sharpness. In 2 Kings 6:5 it is the translation of a word used with reference to its being made of iron. In Isa. 44:12 the Revised Version renders by \"axe\" the Hebrew maatsad, which means a \"hewing\" instrument. In the Authorized Version it is rendered \"tongs.\" It is also used in Jer. 10:3, and rendered \"axe.\" The \"battle-axe\" (army of Medes and Persians) mentioned in Jer. 51:20 was probably, as noted in the margin of the Revised Version, a \"maul\" or heavy mace. In Ps. 74:6 the word so rendered means \"feller.\" (See the figurative expression in Matt. 3:10; Luke 3:9.)"}]}
