{"word":"Ono","sections":[{"paragraph":"A town of Benjamin, in the \"plain of Ono\" (1 Chr. 8:12; Ezra 2:33); now Kefr Ana, 5 miles north of Lydda, and about 30 miles north-west of Jerusalem. Not succeeding in their attempts to deter Nehemiah from rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem, Sanballat and Tobiah resorted to strategem, and pretending to wish a conference with him, they invited him to meet them at Ono. Four times they made the request, and every time Nehemiah refused to come. Their object was to take him prisoner."}]}
