{"word":"Naked","sections":[{"paragraph":"This word denotes (1) absolute nakedness (Gen. 2:25; Job 1:21; Eccl. 5:15; Micah 1:8; Amos 2:16); (2) being poorly clad (Isa. 58:7; James 2:15). It denotes also (3) the state of one who has laid aside his loose outer garment (Lat. nudus), and appears clothed only in a long tunic or under robe worn next the skin (1 Sam. 19:24; Isa. 47:3; comp. Mark 14:52; John 21:7). It is used figuratively, meaning \"being discovered\" or \"made manifest\" (Job 26:6; Heb. 4:13). In Ex. 32:25 the expression \"the people were naked\" (A.V.) is more correctly rendered in the Revised Version \"the people were broken loose\", i.e., had fallen into a state of lawlessness and insubordination. In 2 Chr. 28:19 the words \"he made Judah naked\" (A.V.), but Revised Version \"he had dealt wantonly in Judah,\" mean \"he had permitted Judah to break loose from all the restraints of religion.\""}]}
