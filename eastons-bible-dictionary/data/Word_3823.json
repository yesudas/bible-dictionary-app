{"word":"Witchcraft","sections":[{"paragraph":"(1 Sam. 15:23; 2 Kings 9:22; 2 Chr. 33:6; Micah 5:12; Nahum 3:4; Gal. 5:20). In the popular sense of the word no mention is made either of witches or of witchcraft in Scripture."},{"paragraph":"The \"witch of En-dor\" (1 Sam. 28) was a necromancer, i.e., one who feigned to hold converse with the dead. The damsel with \"a spirit of divination\" (Acts 16:16) was possessed by an evil spirit, or, as the words are literally rendered, \"having a spirit, a pithon.\" The reference is to the heathen god Apollo, who was regarded as the god of prophecy."}]}
