{"word":"Shittah-tree","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Isa. 41:19; R.V., \"acacia tree\"). Shittah wood was employed in making the various parts of the tabernacle in the wilderness, and must therefore have been indigenous in the desert in which the Israelites wandered. It was the acacia or mimosa (Acacia Nilotica and A. seyal). \"The wild acacia (Mimosa Nilotica), under the name of sunt, everywhere represents the seneh, or senna, of the burning bush. A slightly different form of the tree, equally common under the name of seyal, is the ancient \u0027shittah,\u0027 or, as more usually expressed in the plural form, the \u0027shittim,\u0027 of which the tabernacle was made.\" Stanley\u0027s Sinai, etc. (Ex. 25:10, 13, 23, 28)."}]}
