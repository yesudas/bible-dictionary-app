{"word":"Jesse","sections":[{"paragraph":"Firm, or a gift, a son of Obed, the son of Boaz and Ruth (Ruth 4:17, 22; Matt. 1:5, 6; Luke 3:32). He was the father of eight sons, the youngest of whom was David (1 Sam. 17:12). The phrase \"stem of Jesse\" is used for the family of David (Isa. 11:1), and \"root of Jesse\" for the Messiah (Isa. 11:10; Rev. 5:5). Jesse was a man apparently of wealth and position at Bethlehem (1 Sam. 17:17, 18, 20; Ps. 78:71). The last reference to him is of David\u0027s procuring for him an asylum with the king of Moab (1 Sam. 22:3)."}]}
