{"word":"Boar","sections":[{"paragraph":"Occurs only in Ps. 80:13. The same Hebrew word is elsewhere rendered \"swine\" (Lev. 11:7; Deut. 14:8; Prov. 11:22; Isa. 65:4; 66:3, 17). The Hebrews abhorred swine\u0027s flesh, and accordingly none of these animals were reared, except in the district beyond the Sea of Galilee. In the psalm quoted above the powers that destroyed the Jewish nation are compared to wild boars and wild beasts of the field."}]}
