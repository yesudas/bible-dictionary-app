In Isa. 65:16, the Authorized Version has \"the God of truth,\" which in Hebrew is \"the God of Amen.\" It is frequently used by our Saviour to give emphasis to his words, where it is translated \"verily.\" Sometimes, only, however, in John\u0027s Gospel, it is repeated, \"Verily, verily.\" It is used as an epithet of the Lord Jesus Christ (Rev. 3:14)."},{"paragraph":"It is found singly and sometimes doubly at the end of prayers (Ps. 41:13; 72:19; 89:52), to confirm the words and invoke the fulfilment of them. It is used in token of being bound by an oath (Num. 5:22; Deut. 27:15-26; Neh. 5:13; 8:6; 1 Chr. 16:36). In the primitive churches it was common for the general audience to say \"Amen\" at the close of the prayer (1 Cor. 14:16)."},{"paragraph":"The promises of God are Amen; i.e., they are all true and sure (2 Cor. 1:20)."}]}
