{"word":"Crane","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Isa. 38:14; Jer. 8:7). In both of these passages the Authorized Version has reversed the Hebrew order of the words. \"Crane or swallow\" should be \"swallow or crane,\" as in the Revised Version. The rendering is there correct. The Hebrew for crane is \u0027agur, the Grus cincerea, a bird well known in Palestine. It is migratory, and is distinguished by its loud voice, its cry being hoarse and melancholy."}]}
