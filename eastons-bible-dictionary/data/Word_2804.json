{"word":"Orion","sections":[{"paragraph":"Heb. Kesil; i.e., \"the fool\", the name of a constellation (Job 9:9; 38:31; Amos 5:8) consisting of about eighty stars. The Vulgate renders thus, but the LXX. renders by Hesperus, i.e., \"the evening-star,\" Venus. The Orientals \"appear to have conceived of this constellation under the figure of an impious giant bound upon the sky.\" This giant was, according to tradition, Nimrod, the type of the folly that contends against God. In Isa. 13:10 the plural form of the Hebrew word is rendered \"constellations.\""}]}
