{"word":"Pieces","sections":[{"paragraph":"(1) of silver. In Ps. 68:30 denotes \"fragments,\" and not properly money. In 1 Sam. 2:36 (Heb. agorah), properly a \"small sum\" as wages, weighed rather than coined. Josh. 24:32 (Heb. kesitah, q.v.), supposed by some to have been a piece of money bearing the figure of a lamb, but rather simply a certain amount. (Comp. Gen. 33:19)."},{"paragraph":"(2.) The word pieces is omitted in many passages, as Gen. 20:16; 37:28; 45:22, etc. The passage in Zech. 11:12, 13 is quoted in the Gospel (Matt. 26:15), and from this we know that the word to be supplied is \"shekels.\" In all these omissions we may thus warrantably supply this word."},{"paragraph":"(3.) The \"piece of money\" mentioned in Matt. 17:27 is a stater\u003da Hebrew shekel, or four Greek drachmae; and that in Luke 15:8, 9, Act 19:19, a Greek drachma\u003da denarius. (See [487]PENNY.)"}]}
