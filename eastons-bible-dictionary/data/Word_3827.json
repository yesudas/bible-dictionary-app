{"word":"Wolf","sections":[{"paragraph":"Heb. zeeb, frequently referred to in Scripture as an emblem of treachery and cruelty. Jacob\u0027s prophecy, \"Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf\" (Gen. 49:27), represents the warlike character of that tribe (see Judg. 19-21). Isaiah represents the peace of Messiah\u0027s kingdom by the words, \"The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb\" (Isa. 11:6). The habits of the wolf are described in Jer. 5:6; Hab. 1:8; Zeph. 3:3; Ezek. 22:27; Matt. 7:15; 10:16; Acts 20:29. Wolves are still sometimes found in Palestine, and are the dread of shepherds, as of old."}]}
