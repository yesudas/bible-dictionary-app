{"word":"Thistle","sections":[{"paragraph":"(1.) Heb. hoah (2 Kings 14:9; Job 31:40). In Job 41:2 the Hebrew word is rendered \"thorn,\" but in the Revised Version \"hook.\" It is also rendered \"thorn\" in 2 Chr. 33:11; Prov. 26:9; Cant. 2:2; \"brambles\" in Isa. 34:13. It is supposed to be a variety of the wild plum-tree, but by some it is regarded as the common thistle, of which there are many varieties in Palestine."},{"paragraph":"(2.) Heb. dardar, meaning \"a plant growing luxuriantly\" (Gen. 3:18; Hos. 10:8); Gr. tribolos, \"a triple point\" (Matt. 7:16; Heb. 6:8, \"brier,\" R.V. \"thistle\"). This was probably the star-thistle, called by botanists Centaurea calcitropa, or \"caltrops,\" a weed common in corn-fields. (See [631]THORNS.)"}]}
