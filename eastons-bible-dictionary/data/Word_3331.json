{"word":"Shechinah","sections":[{"paragraph":"A Chaldee word meaning resting-place, not found in Scripture, but used by the later Jews to designate the visible symbol of God\u0027s presence in the tabernacle, and afterwards in Solomon\u0027s temple. When the Lord led Israel out of Egypt, he went before them \"in a pillar of a cloud.\" This was the symbol of his presence with his people. For references made to it during the wilderness wanderings, see Ex. 14:20; 40:34-38; Lev. 9:23, 24; Num. 14:10; 16:19, 42."},{"paragraph":"It is probable that after the entrance into Canaan this glory-cloud settled in the tabernacle upon the ark of the covenant in the most holy place. We have, however, no special reference to it till the consecration of the temple by Solomon, when it filled the whole house with its glory, so that the priests could not stand to minister (1 Kings 8:10-13; 2 Chr. 5:13, 14; 7:1-3). Probably it remained in the first temple in the holy of holies as the symbol of Jehovah\u0027s presence so long as that temple stood. It afterwards disappeared. (See [577]CLOUD.)"}]}
