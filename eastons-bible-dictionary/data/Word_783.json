{"word":"Cheese","sections":[{"paragraph":"(A.S. cese). This word occurs three times in the Authorized Version as the translation of three different Hebrew words: (1.) 1 Sam. 17:18, \"ten cheeses;\" i.e., ten sections of curd. (2.) 2 Sam. 17:29, \"cheese of kine\" \u003d perhaps curdled milk of kine. The Vulgate version reads \"fat calves.\" (3.) Job 10:10, curdled milk is meant by the word."}]}
