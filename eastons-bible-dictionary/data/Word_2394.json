{"word":"Mallows","sections":[{"paragraph":"Occurs only in Job 30:4 (R.V., \"saltwort\"). The word so rendered (malluah, from melah, \"salt\") most probably denotes the Atriplex halimus of Linnaeus, a species of sea purslane found on the shores of the Dead Sea, as also of the Mediterranean, and in salt marshes. It is a tall shrubby orach, growing to the height sometimes of 10 feet. Its buds and leaves, with those of other saline plants, are eaten by the poor in Palestine."}]}
