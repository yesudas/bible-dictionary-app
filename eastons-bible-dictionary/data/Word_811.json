{"word":"Chittim","sections":[{"paragraph":"Or Kittim, a plural form (Gen. 10:4), the name of a branch of the descendants of Javan, the \"son\" of Japheth. Balaam foretold (Num. 24:24) \"that ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and afflict Eber.\" Daniel prophesied (11:30) that the ships of Chittim would come against the king of the north. It probably denotes Cyprus, whose ancient capital was called Kition by the Greeks."},{"paragraph":"The references elsewhere made to Chittim (Isa. 23:1, 12; Jer. 2:10; Ezek. 27:6) are to be explained on the ground that while the name originally designated the Phoenicians only, it came latterly to be used of all the islands and various settlements on the sea-coasts which they had occupied, and then of the people who succeeded them when the Phoenician power decayed. Hence it designates generally the islands and coasts of the Mediterranean and the races that inhabit them."}]}
