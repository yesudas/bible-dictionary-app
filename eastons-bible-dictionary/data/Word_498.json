{"word":"Bee","sections":[{"paragraph":"First mentioned in Deut. 1:44. Swarms of bees, and the danger of their attacks, are mentioned in Ps. 118:12. Samson found a \"swarm of bees\" in the carcass of a lion he had slain (Judg. 14:8). Wild bees are described as laying up honey in woods and in clefts of rocks (Deut. 32:13; Ps. 81:16). In Isa. 7:18 the \"fly\" and the \"bee\" are personifications of the Egyptians and Assyrians, the inveterate enemies of Israel."}]}
