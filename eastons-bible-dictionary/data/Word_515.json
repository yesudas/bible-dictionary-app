{"word":"Belial","sections":[{"paragraph":"Worthlessness, frequently used in the Old Testament as a proper name. It is first used in Deut. 13:13. In the New Testament it is found only in 2 Cor. 6:15, where it is used as a name of Satan, the personification of all that is evil. It is translated \"wicked\" in Deut. 15:9; Ps. 41:8 (R.V. marg.); 101:3; Prov. 6:12, etc. The expression \"son\" or \"man of Belial\" means simply a worthless, lawless person (Judg. 19:22; 20:13; 1 Sam. 1:16; 2:12)."}]}
