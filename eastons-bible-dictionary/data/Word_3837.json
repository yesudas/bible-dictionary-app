{"word":"Wormwood","sections":[{"paragraph":"Heb. la\u0027anah, the Artemisia absinthium of botanists. It is noted for its intense bitterness (Deut. 29:18; Prov. 5:4; Jer. 9:15; Amos 5:7). It is a type of bitterness, affliction, remorse, punitive suffering. In Amos 6:12 this Hebrew word is rendered \"hemlock\" (R.V., \"wormwood\"). In the symbolical language of the Apocalypse (Rev. 8:10, 11) a star is represented as falling on the waters of the earth, causing the third part of the water to turn wormwood."},{"paragraph":"The name by which the Greeks designated it, absinthion, means \"undrinkable.\" The absinthe of France is distilled from a species of this plant. The \"southernwood\" or \"old man,\" cultivated in cottage gardens on account of its fragrance, is another species of it."}]}
