{"word":"Soothsayer","sections":[{"paragraph":"One who pretends to prognosticate future events. Baalam is so called (Josh. 13:22; Heb. kosem, a \"diviner,\" as rendered 1 Sam. 6:2; rendered \"prudent,\" Isa. 3:2). In Isa. 2:6 and Micah 5:12 (Heb. yonenim, i.e., \"diviners of the clouds\") the word is used of the Chaldean diviners who studied the clouds. In Dan. 2:27; 5:7 the word is the rendering of the Chaldee gazrin, i.e., \"deciders\" or \"determiners\", here applied to Chaldean astrologers, \"who, by casting nativities from the place of the stars at one\u0027s birth, and by various arts of computing and divining, foretold the fortunes and destinies of individuals.\", Gesenius, Lex. Heb. (See [602]SORCERER.)"}]}
