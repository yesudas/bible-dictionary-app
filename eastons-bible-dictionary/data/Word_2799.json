{"word":"Oracle","sections":[{"paragraph":"In the Old Testament used in every case, except 2 Sam. 16:23, to denote the most holy place in the temple (1 Kings 6:5, 19-23; 8:6). In 2 Sam. 16:23 it means the Word of God. A man inquired \"at the oracle of God\" by means of the Urim and Thummim in the breastplate on the high priest\u0027s ephod. In the New Testament it is used only in the plural, and always denotes the Word of God (Rom. 3:2; Heb. 5:12, etc.). The Scriptures are called \"living oracles\" (comp. Heb. 4:12) because of their quickening power (Acts 7:38)."}]}
