{"word":"Daemon","sections":[{"paragraph":"The Greek form, rendered \"devil\" in the Authorized Version of the New Testament. Daemons are spoken of as spiritual beings (Matt. 8:16; 10:1; 12:43-45) at enmity with God, and as having a certain power over man (James 2:19; Rev. 16:14). They recognize our Lord as the Son of God (Matt. 8:20; Luke 4:41). They belong to the number of those angels that \"kept not their first estate,\" \"unclean spirits,\" \"fallen angels,\" the angels of the devil (Matt. 25:41; Rev. 12:7-9). They are the \"principalities and powers\" against which we must \"wrestle\" (Eph. 6:12)."}]}
