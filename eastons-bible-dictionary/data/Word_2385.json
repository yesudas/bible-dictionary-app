{"word":"Makkedah","sections":[{"paragraph":"Herdsman\u0027s place, one of the royal cities of the Canaanites (Josh. 12:16), near which was a cave where the five kings who had confederated against Israel sought refuge (10:10-29). They were put to death by Joshua, who afterwards suspended their bodies upon five trees. It has been identified with the modern village called Sumeil, standing on a low hill about 7 miles to the north-west of Eleutheropolis (Beit Jibrin), where are ancient remains and a great cave. The Palestine Exploration surveyors have, however, identified it with el-Mughar, or \"the caves,\" 3 miles from Jabneh and 2 1/2 southwest of Ekron, because, they say, \"at this site only of all possible sites for Makkedah in the Palestine plain do caves still exist.\" (See [373]ADONI-ZEDEC.)"}]}
