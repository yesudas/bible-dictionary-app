{"word":"Oil-tree","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Isa. 41:19; R.V. marg., \"oleaster\"), Heb. etz shemen, rendered \"olive tree\" in 1 Kings 6:23, 31, 32, 33 (R.V., \"olive wood\") and \"pine branches\" in Neh. 8:15 (R.V., \"branches of wild olive\"), was some tree distinct from the olive. It was probably the oleaster (Eleagnus angustifolius), which grows abundantly in almost all parts of Palestine, especially about Hebron and Samaria. \"It has a fine hard wood,\" says Tristram, \"and yields an inferior oil, but it has no relationship to the olive, which, however, it resembles in general appearance.\""}]}
