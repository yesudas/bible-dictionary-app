{"word":"Mamre","sections":[{"paragraph":"Manliness. (1.) An Amoritish chief in alliance with Abraham (Gen. 14:13, 24)."},{"paragraph":"(2.) The name of the place in the neighbourhood of Hebron (q.v.) where Abraham dwelt (Gen. 23:17, 19; 35:27); called also in Authorized Version (13:18) the \"plain of Mamre,\" but in Revised Version more correctly \"the oaks [marg., terebinths\u0027] of Mamre.\" The name probably denotes the \"oak grove\" or the \"wood of Mamre,\" thus designated after Abraham\u0027s ally."},{"paragraph":"This \"grove\" must have been within sight of or \"facing\" Machpelah (q.v.). The site of Mamre has been identified with Ballatet Selta, i.e., \"the oak of rest\", where there is a tree called \"Abraham\u0027s oak,\" about a mile and a half west of Hebron. Others identify it with er-Rameh, 2 miles north of Hebron."}]}
