{"word":"Riblah","sections":[{"paragraph":"Fruitful, an ancient town on the northern frontier of Palestine, 35 miles north-east of Baalbec, and 10 or 12 south of Lake Homs, on the eastern bank of the Orontes, in a wide and fertile plain. Here Nebuchadnezzar had his head-quarters in his campaign against Jerusalem, and here also Necho fixed his camp after he had routed Josiah\u0027s army at Megiddo (2 Kings 23:29-35; 25:6, 20, 21; Jer. 39:5; 52:10). It was on the great caravan road from Palestine to Carchemish, on the Euphrates. It is described (Num. 34:11) as \"on the eastern side of Ain.\" A place still called el Ain, i.e., \"the fountain\", is found in such a position about 10 miles distant. (See [534]JERUSALEM.)"}]}
