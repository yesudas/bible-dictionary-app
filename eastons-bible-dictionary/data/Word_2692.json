{"word":"Needle","sections":[{"paragraph":"Used only in the proverb, \"to pass through a needle\u0027s eye\" (Matt. 19:24; Mark 10:25; Luke 18:25). Some interpret the expression as referring to the side gate, close to the principal gate, usually called the \"eye of a needle\" in the East; but it is rather to be taken literally. The Hebrew females were skilled in the use of the needle (Ex. 28:39; 26:36; Judg. 5:30)."}]}
