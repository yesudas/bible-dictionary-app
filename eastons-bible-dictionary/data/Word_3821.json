{"word":"Wise, wisdom","sections":[{"paragraph":"A moral rather than an intellectual quality. To be \"foolish\" is to be godless (Ps. 14:1; comp. Judg. 19:23; 2 Sam. 13:13). True wisdom is a gift from God to those who ask it (Job 28:12-28; Prov. 3:13-18; Rom. 1:22; 16:27; 1 Cor. 1:17-21; 2:6-8; James 1:5). \"Wisdom\" in Prov. 1:20; 8:1; 9:1-5 may be regarded not as a mere personification of the attribute of wisdom, but as a divine person, \"Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God\" (1 Cor. 1:24). In Matt. 11:19 it is the personified principle of wisdom that is meant."}]}
