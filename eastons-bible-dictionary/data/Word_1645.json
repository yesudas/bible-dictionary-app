{"word":"Harness","sections":[{"paragraph":"(1.) Heb. asar, \"to bind;\" hence the act of fastening animals to a cart (1 Sam. 6:7, 10; Jer. 46:4, etc.)."},{"paragraph":"(2.) An Old English word for \"armour;\" Heb. neshek (2 Chr. 9:24)."},{"paragraph":"(3.) Heb. shiryan, a coat of mail (1 Kings 22:34; 2 Chr. 18:33; rendered \"breastplate\" in Isa. 59:17)."},{"paragraph":"(4.) The children of Israel passed out of Egypt \"harnessed\" (Ex. 13:18), i.e., in an orderly manner, and as if to meet a foe. The word so rendered is probably a derivative from Hebrew hamesh (i.e., \"five\"), and may denote that they went up in five divisions, viz., the van, centre, two wings, and rear-guard."}]}
