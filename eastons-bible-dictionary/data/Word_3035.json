{"word":"Queen","sections":[{"paragraph":"No explicit mention of queens is made till we read of the \"queen of Sheba.\" The wives of the kings of Israel are not so designated. In Ps. 45:9, the Hebrew for \"queen\" is not malkah, one actually ruling like the Queen of Sheba, but shegal, which simply means the king\u0027s wife. In 1 Kings 11:19, Pharaoh\u0027s wife is called \"the queen,\" but the Hebrew word so rendered (g\u0027birah) is simply a title of honour, denoting a royal lady, used sometimes for \"queen-mother\" (1 Kings 15:13; 2 Chron. 15:16). In Cant. 6:8, 9, the king\u0027s wives are styled \"queens\" (Heb. melakhoth)."},{"paragraph":"In the New Testament we read of the \"queen of the south\", i.e., Southern Arabia, Sheba (Matt. 12:42; Luke 11:31) and the \"queen of the Ethiopians\" (Acts 8:27), Candace."}]}
