{"word":"Gate","sections":[{"paragraph":"(1.) Of cities, as of Jerusalem (Jer. 37:13; Neh. 1:3; 2:3; 3:3), of Sodom (Gen. 19:1), of Gaza (Judg. 16:3)."},{"paragraph":"(2.) Of royal palaces (Neh. 2:8)."},{"paragraph":"(3.) Of the temple of Solomon (1 Kings 6:34, 35; 2 Kings 18:16); of the holy place (1 Kings 6:31, 32; Ezek. 41:23, 24); of the outer courts of the temple, the beautiful gate (Acts 3:2)."},{"paragraph":"(4.) Tombs (Matt. 27:60)."},{"paragraph":"(5.) Prisons (Acts 12:10; 16:27)."},{"paragraph":"(6.) Caverns (1 Kings 19:13)."},{"paragraph":"(7.) Camps (Ex. 32:26, 27; Heb. 13:12)."},{"paragraph":"The materials of which gates were made were,"},{"paragraph":"(1.) Iron and brass (Ps. 107:16; Isa. 45:2; Acts 12:10)."},{"paragraph":"(2.) Stones and pearls (Isa. 54:12; Rev. 21:21)."},{"paragraph":"(3.) Wood (Judg. 16:3) probably."},{"paragraph":"At the gates of cities courts of justice were frequently held, and hence \"judges of the gate\" are spoken of (Deut. 16:18; 17:8; 21:19; 25:6, 7, etc.). At the gates prophets also frequently delivered their messages (Prov. 1:21; 8:3; Isa. 29:21; Jer. 17:19, 20; 26:10). Criminals were punished without the gates (1 Kings 21:13; Acts 7:59). By the \"gates of righteousness\" we are probably to understand those of the temple (Ps. 118:19). \"The gates of hell\" (R.V., \"gates of Hades\") Matt. 16:18, are generally interpreted as meaning the power of Satan, but probably they may mean the power of death, denoting that the Church of Christ shall never die."}]}
