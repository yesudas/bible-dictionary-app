{"word":"Head-dress","sections":[{"paragraph":"Not in common use among the Hebrews. It is first mentioned in Ex. 28:40 (A.V., \"bonnets;\" R.V., \"head-tires\"). It was used especially for purposes of ornament (Job 29:14; Isa. 3:23; 62:3). The Hebrew word here used, tsaniph, properly means a turban, folds of linen wound round the head. The Hebrew word peer, used in Isa. 61:3, there rendered \"beauty\" (A.V.) and \"garland\" (R.V.), is a head-dress or turban worn by females (Isa. 3: 20, \"bonnets\"), priests (Ex. 39:28), a bridegroom (Isa. 61:10, \"ornament;\" R.V., \"garland\"). Ezek. 16:10 and Jonah 2:5 are to be understood of the turban wrapped round the head. The Hebrew shebisim (Isa. 3:18), in the Authorized Version rendered \"cauls,\" and marg. \"networks,\" denotes probably a kind of netted head-dress. The \"horn\" (Heb. keren) mentioned in 1 Sam. 2:1 is the head-dress called by the Druses of Mount Lebanon the tantura."}]}
