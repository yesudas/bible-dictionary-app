{"word":"Ash","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Heb. o\u0027ren, \"tremulous\"), mentioned only Isa. 44:14 (R.V., \"fir tree\"). It is rendered \"pine tree\" both in the LXX. and Vulgate versions. There is a tree called by the Arabs aran, found still in the valleys of Arabia Petraea, whose leaf resembles that of the mountain ash. This may be the tree meant. Our ash tree is not known in Syria."}]}
