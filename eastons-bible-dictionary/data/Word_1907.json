{"word":"Island","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Heb. i, \"dry land,\" as opposed to water) occurs in its usual signification (Isa. 42:4, 10, 12, 15, comp. Jer. 47:4), but more frequently simply denotes a maritime region or sea-coast (Isa. 20:6, R.V.,\" coastland;\" 23:2, 6; Jer. 2:10; Ezek. 27:6, 7). (See [300]CHITTIM.) The shores of the Mediterranean are called the \"islands of the sea\" (Isa. 11:11), or the \"isles of the Gentiles\" (Gen. 10:5), and sometimes simply \"isles\" (Ps. 72:10); Ezek. 26:15, 18; 27:3, 35; Dan. 11:18)."}]}
