{"word":"Arch","sections":[{"paragraph":"An architectural term found only in Ezek. 40:16, 21, 22, 26, 29. There is no absolute proof that the Israelites employed arches in their buildings. The arch was employed in the building of the pyramids of Egypt. The oldest existing arch is at Thebes, and bears the date B.C. 1350. There are also still found the remains of an arch, known as Robinson\u0027s Arch, of the bridge connecting Zion and Moriah. (See TYROPOEON [25]VALLEY.)"}]}
