{"word":"Chamber","sections":[{"paragraph":"\"on the wall,\" which the Shunammite prepared for the prophet Elisha (2 Kings 4:10), was an upper chamber over the porch through the hall toward the street. This was the \"guest chamber\" where entertainments were prepared (Mark 14:14). There were also \"chambers within chambers\" (1 Kings 22:25; 2 Kings 9:2). To enter into a chamber is used metaphorically of prayer and communion with God (Isa. 26:20). The \"chambers of the south\" (Job 9:9) are probably the constelations of the southern hemisphere. The \"chambers of imagery\", i.e., chambers painted with images, as used by Ezekiel (8:12), is an expression denoting the vision the prophet had of the abominations practised by the Jews in Jerusalem."}]}
