{"word":"Caterpillar","sections":[{"paragraph":"The consumer. Used in the Old Testament (1 Kings 8:37; 2 Chr. 6:28; Ps. 78:46; Isa. 33:4) as the translation of a word (hasil) the root of which means \"to devour\" or \"consume,\" and which is used also with reference to the locust in Deut. 28:38. It may have been a species of locust, or the name of one of the transformations through which the locust passes, locust-grub. It is also found (Ps. 105:34; Jer. 51:14, 27; R.V., \"cankerworm\") as the rendering of a different Hebrew word, yelek, a word elsewhere rendered \"cankerworm\" (q.v.), Joel 1:4; 2:25. (See [103]LOCUST.)"}]}
