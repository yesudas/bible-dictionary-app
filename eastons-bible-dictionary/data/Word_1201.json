{"word":"Encamp","sections":[{"paragraph":"An encampment was the resting-place for a longer or shorter period of an army or company of travellers (Ex. 13:20; 14:19; Josh. 10:5; 11:5)."},{"paragraph":"The manner in which the Israelites encamped during their march through the wilderness is described in Num. 2 and 3. The order of the encampment (see [185]CAMP) was preserved in the march (Num. 2:17), the signal for which was the blast of two silver trumpets. Detailed regulations affecting the camp for sanitary purposes are given (Lev. 4:11, 12; 6:11; 8:17; 10:4, 5; 13:46; 14:3; Num. 12:14, 15; 31:19; Deut. 23:10, 12)."},{"paragraph":"Criminals were executed without the camp (Lev. 4:12; comp. John 19:17, 20), and there also the young bullock for a sin-offering was burnt (Lev. 24:14; comp. Heb. 13:12)."},{"paragraph":"In the subsequent history of Israel frequent mention is made of their encampments in the time of war (Judg. 7:18; 1 Sam. 13:2, 3, 16, 23; 17:3; 29:1; 30:9, 24). The temple was sometimes called \"the camp of the Lord\" (2 Chr. 31:2, R.V.; comp. Ps. 78:28). The multitudes who flocked to David are styled \"a great host (i.e., \"camp;\" Heb. mahaneh), like the host of God\" (1 Chr. 12:22)."}]}
