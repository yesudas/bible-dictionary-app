{"word":"Street","sections":[{"paragraph":"The street called \"Straight\" at Damascus (Acts 9:11) is \"a long broad street, running from east to west, about a mile in length, and forming the principal thoroughfare in the city.\" In Oriental towns streets are usually narrow and irregular and filthy (Ps. 18:42; Isa. 10:6). \"It is remarkable,\" says Porter, \"that all the important cities of Palestine and Syria Samaria, Caesarea, Gerasa, Bozrah, Damascus, Palmyra, had their straight streets\u0027 running through the centre of the city, and lined with stately rows of columns. The most perfect now remaining are those of Palmyra and Gerasa, where long ranges of the columns still stand.\", Through Samaria, etc."}]}
