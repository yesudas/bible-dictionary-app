{"word":"Tiphsah","sections":[{"paragraph":"Passing over; ford, one of the boundaries of Solomon\u0027s dominions (1 Kings 4:24), probably \"Thapsacus, a great and wealthy town on the western bank of the Euphrates,\" about 100 miles north-east of Tadmor. All the land traffic between the east and the west passed through it. Menahem undertook an expedition against this city, and \"smote Tiphsah and all that were therein\" (2 Kings 15:16). This expedition implied a march of some 300 miles from Tirzah if by way of Tadmor, and about 400 if by way of Aleppo; and its success showed the strength of the Israelite kingdom, for it was practically a defiance to Assyria. Conder, however, identifies this place with Khurbet Tafsah, some 6 miles west of Shechem."}]}
