{"word":"Sermon on the mount","sections":[{"paragraph":"After spending a night in solemn meditation and prayer in the lonely mountain-range to the west of the Lake of Galilee (Luke 6:12), on the following morning our Lord called to him his disciples, and from among them chose twelve, who were to be henceforth trained to be his apostles (Mark 3:14, 15). After this solemn consecration of the twelve, he descended from the mountain-peak to a more level spot (Luke 6:17), and there he sat down and delivered the \"sermon on the mount\" (Matt. 5-7; Luke 6:20-49) to the assembled multitude. The mountain here spoken of was probably that known by the name of the \"Horns of Hattin\" (Kurun Hattin), a ridge running east and west, not far from Capernaum. It was afterwards called the \"Mount of Beatitudes.\""}]}
