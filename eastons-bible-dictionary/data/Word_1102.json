{"word":"Ear","sections":[{"paragraph":"Used frequently in a figurative sense (Ps. 34:15). To \"uncover the ear\" is to show respect to a person (1 Sam. 20:2 marg.). To have the \"ear heavy\", or to have \"uncircumcised ears\" (Isa. 6:10), is to be inattentive and disobedient. To have the ear \"bored\" through with an awl was a sign of perpetual servitude (Ex. 21:6)."}]}
