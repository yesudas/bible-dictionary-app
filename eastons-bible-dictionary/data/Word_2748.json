In Hos. 9:6 the Hebrew name is Moph, and is translated \"Memphis,\" which is its Greek and Latin form. It was one of the most ancient and important cities of Egypt, and stood a little to the south of the modern Cairo, on the western bank of the Nile. It was the capital of Lower Egypt. Among the ruins found at this place is a colossal statue of Rameses the Great. (See [445]MEMPHIS.)"}]}
