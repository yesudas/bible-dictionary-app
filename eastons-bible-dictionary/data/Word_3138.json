{"word":"River","sections":[{"paragraph":"(1.) Heb. aphik, properly the channel or ravine that holds water (2 Sam. 22:16), translated \"brook,\" \"river,\" \"stream,\" but not necessarily a perennial stream (Ezek. 6:3; 31:12; 32:6; 34:13)."},{"paragraph":"(2.) Heb. nahal, in winter a \"torrent,\" in summer a \"wady\" or valley (Gen. 32:23; Deut. 2:24; 3:16; Isa. 30:28; Lam. 2:18; Ezek. 47:9)."},{"paragraph":"These winter torrents sometimes come down with great suddenness and with desolating force. A distinguished traveller thus describes his experience in this matter:, \"I was encamped in Wady Feiran, near the base of Jebel Serbal, when a tremendous thunderstorm burst upon us. After little more than an hour\u0027s rain, the water rose so rapidly in the previously dry wady that I had to run for my life, and with great difficulty succeeded in saving my tent and goods; my boots, which I had not time to pick up, were washed away. In less than two hours a dry desert wady upwards of 300 yards broad was turned into a foaming torrent from 8 to 10 feet deep, roaring and tearing down and bearing everything upon it, tangled masses of tamarisks, hundreds of beautiful palmtrees, scores of sheep and goats, camels and donkeys, and even men, women, and children, for a whole encampment of Arabs was washed away a few miles above me. The storm commenced at five in the evening; at half-past nine the waters were rapidly subsiding, and it was evident that the flood had spent its force.\" (Comp. Matt. 7:27; Luke 6:49.)"},{"paragraph":"(3.) Nahar, a \"river\" continuous and full, a perennial stream, as the Jordan, the Euphrates (Gen. 2:10; 15:18; Deut. 1:7; Ps. 66:6; Ezek. 10:15)."},{"paragraph":"(4.) Tel\u0027alah, a conduit, or water-course (1 Kings 18:32; 2 Kings 18:17; 20:20; Job 38:25; Ezek. 31:4)."},{"paragraph":"(5.) Peleg, properly \"waters divided\", i.e., streams divided, throughout the land (Ps. 1:3); \"the rivers [i.e., divisions\u0027] of waters\" (Job 20:17; 29:6; Prov. 5:16)."},{"paragraph":"(6.) Ye\u0027or, i.e., \"great river\", probably from an Egyptian word (Aur), commonly applied to the Nile (Gen. 41:1-3), but also to other rivers (Job 28:10; Isa. 33:21)."},{"paragraph":"(7.)
