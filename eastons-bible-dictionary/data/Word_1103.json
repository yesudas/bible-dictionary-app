{"word":"Earing","sections":[{"paragraph":"An Old English word (from the Latin aro, I plough), meaning \"ploughing.\" It is used in the Authorized Version in Gen. 45:6; Ex. 34:21; 1 Sam. 8:12; Deut. 21:4; Isa. 30:24; but the Revised Version has rendered the original in these places by the ordinary word to plough or till."}]}
