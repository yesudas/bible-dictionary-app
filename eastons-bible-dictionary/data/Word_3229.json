{"word":"Satyr","sections":[{"paragraph":"Hairy one. Mentioned in Greek mythology as a creature composed of a man and a goat, supposed to inhabit wild and desolate regions. The Hebrew word is rendered also \"goat\" (Lev. 4:24) and \"devil\", i.e., an idol in the form of a goat (17:7; 2 Chr. 11:15). When it is said (Isa. 13:21; comp. 34:14) \"the satyrs shall dance there,\" the meaning is that the place referred to shall become a desolate waste. Some render the Hebrew word \"baboon,\" a species of which is found in Babylonia."}]}
