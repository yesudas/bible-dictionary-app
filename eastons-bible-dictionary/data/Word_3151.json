{"word":"Roll","sections":[{"paragraph":"The common form of ancient books. The Hebrew word rendered \"roll\" or \"volume\" is meghillah, found in Ezra 6:2; Ps. 40:7; Jer. 36:2, 6, 23, 28, 29; Ezek. 2:9; 3:1-3; Zech. 5:1, 2. \"Rolls\" (Chald. pl. of sephar, corresponding to Heb. sepher) in Ezra 6:1 is rendered in the Revised Version \"archives.\" In the New Testament the word \"volume\" (Heb. 10:7; R.V., \"roll\") occurs as the rendering of the Greek kephalis, meaning the head or top of the stick or cylinder on which the manuscript was rolled, and hence the manuscript itself. (See [537]BOOK.)"}]}
