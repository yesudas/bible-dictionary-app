{"word":"Prince","sections":[{"paragraph":"The title generally applied to the chief men of the state. The \"princes of the provinces\" (1 Kings 20:14) were the governors or lord-lieutenants of the provinces. So also the \"princes\" mentioned in Dan. 6:1, 3, 4, 6, 7 were the officers who administered the affairs of the provinces; the \"satraps\" (as rendered in R.V.). These are also called \"lieutenants\" (Esther 3:12; 8:9; R.V., \"satraps\"). The promised Saviour is called by Daniel (9:25) \"Messiah the Prince\" (Heb. nagid); compare Acts 3:15; 5:31. The angel Micheal is called (Dan. 12:1) a \"prince\" (Heb. sar, whence \"Sarah,\" the \"princes\")."}]}
