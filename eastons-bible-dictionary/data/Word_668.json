{"word":"Bush","sections":[{"paragraph":"In which Jehovah appeared to Moses in the wilderness (Ex. 3:2; Acts 7:30). It is difficult to say what particular kind of plant or bush is here meant. Probably it was the mimosa or acacia. The words \"in the bush\" in Mark 12:26; Luke 20:37, mean \"in the passage or paragraph on the bush;\" i.e., in Ex. 3."}]}
