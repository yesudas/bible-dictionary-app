{"word":"Calvary","sections":[{"paragraph":"Only in Luke 23:33, the Latin name Calvaria, which was used as a translation of the Greek word Kranion, by which the Hebrew word Gulgoleth was interpreted, \"the place of a skull.\" It probably took this name from its shape, being a hillock or low, rounded, bare elevation somewhat in the form of a human skull. It is nowhere in Scripture called a \"hill.\" The crucifixion of our Lord took place outside the city walls (Heb. 13:11-13) and near the public thoroughfare. \"This thing was not done in a corner.\" (See [91]GOLGOTHA.)"}]}
