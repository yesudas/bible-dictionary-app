{"word":"Hammer","sections":[{"paragraph":"(1.) Heb. pattish, used by gold-beaters (Isa. 41:7) and by quarry-men (Jer. 23:29). Metaphorically of Babylon (Jer. 50:23) or Nebuchadnezzar."},{"paragraph":"(2.) Heb. makabah, a stone-cutter\u0027s mallet (1 Kings 6:7), or of any workman (Judg. 4:21; Isa. 44:12)."},{"paragraph":"(3.) Heb. halmuth, a poetical word for a workman\u0027s hammer, found only in Judg. 5:26, where it denotes the mallet with which the pins of the tent of the nomad are driven into the ground."},{"paragraph":"(4.) Heb. mappets, rendered \"battle-axe\" in Jer. 51:20. This was properly a \"mace,\" which is thus described by Rawlinson: \"The Assyrian mace was a short, thin weapon, and must either have been made of a very tough wood or (and this is more probable) of metal. It had an ornamented head, which was sometimes very beautifully modelled, and generally a strap or string at the lower end by which it could be grasped with greater firmness.\""}]}
