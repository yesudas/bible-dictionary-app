{"word":"Olive","sections":[{"paragraph":"The fruit of the olive-tree. This tree yielded oil which was highly valued. The best oil was from olives that were plucked before being fully ripe, and then beaten or squeezed (Deut. 24:20; Isa. 17:6; 24:13). It was called \"beaten,\" or \"fresh oil\" (Ex. 27:20). There were also oil-presses, in which the oil was trodden out by the feet (Micah 6:15). James (3:12) calls the fruit \"olive berries.\" The phrase \"vineyards and olives\" (Judg. 15:5, A.V.) should be simply \"olive-yard,\" or \"olive-garden,\" as in the Revised Version. (See [451]OIL.)"}]}
