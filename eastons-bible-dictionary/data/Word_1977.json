{"word":"Jasher","sections":[{"paragraph":"Upright. \"The Book of Jasher,\" rendered in the LXX. \"the Book of the Upright One,\" by the Vulgate \"the Book of Just Ones,\" was probably a kind of national sacred song-book, a collection of songs in praise of the heroes of Israel, a \"book of golden deeds,\" a national anthology. We have only two specimens from the book, (1) the words of Joshua which he spake to the Lord at the crisis of the battle of Beth-horon (Josh. 10:12, 13); and (2) \"the Song of the Bow,\" that beautiful and touching mournful elegy which David composed on the occasion of the death of Saul and Jonathan (2 Sam. 1:18-27)."}]}
