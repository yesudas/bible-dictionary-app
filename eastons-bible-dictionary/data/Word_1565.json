{"word":"Habitation","sections":[{"paragraph":"God is the habitation of his people, who find rest and safety in him (Ps. 71:3; 91:9). Justice and judgment are the habitation of God\u0027s throne (Ps. 89:14, Heb. mekhon, \"foundation\"), because all his acts are founded on justice and judgment. (See Ps. 132:5, 13; Eph. 2:22, of Canaan, Jerusalem, and the temple as God\u0027s habitation.) God inhabits eternity (Isa. 57:15), i.e., dwells not only among men, but in eternity, where time is unknown; and \"the praises of Israel\" (Ps. 22:3), i.e., he dwells among those praises and is continually surrounded by them."}]}
