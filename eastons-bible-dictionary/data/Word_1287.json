{"word":"Eye","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Heb. ain, meaning \"flowing\"), applied (1) to a fountain, frequently; (2) to colour (Num. 11:7; R.V., \"appearance,\" marg. \"eye\"); (3) the face (Ex. 10:5, 15; Num. 22:5, 11), in Num. 14:14, \"face to face\" (R.V. marg., \"eye to eye\"). \"Between the eyes\", i.e., the forehead (Ex. 13:9, 16)."},{"paragraph":"The expression (Prov. 23:31), \"when it giveth his colour in the cup,\" is literally, \"when it giveth out [or showeth] its eye.\" The beads or bubbles of wine are thus spoken of. \"To set the eyes\" on any one is to view him with favour (Gen. 44:21; Job 24:23; Jer. 39:12). This word is used figuratively in the expressions an \"evil eye\" (Matt. 20:15), a \"bountiful eye\" (Prov. 22:9), \"haughty eyes\" (6:17 marg.), \"wanton eyes\" (Isa. 3:16), \"eyes full of adultery\" (2 Pet. 2:14), \"the lust of the eyes\" (1 John 2:16). Christians are warned against \"eye-service\" (Eph. 6:6; Col. 3:22). Men were sometimes punished by having their eyes put out (1 Sam. 11:2; Samson, Judg. 16:21; Zedekiah, 2 Kings 25:7)."},{"paragraph":"The custom of painting the eyes is alluded to in 2 Kings 9:30, R.V.; Jer. 4:30; Ezek. 23:40, a custom which still prevails extensively among Eastern women."}]}
