{"word":"Michmash","sections":[{"paragraph":"Something hidden, a town of Benjamin (Ezra 2:27), east of Bethel and south of Migron, on the road to Jerusalem (Isa. 10:28). It lay on the line of march of an invading army from the north, on the north side of the steep and precipitous Wady es-Suweinit (\"valley of the little thorn-tree\" or \"the acacia\"), and now bears the name of Mukhmas. This wady is called \"the passage of Michmash\" (1 Sam. 13:23). Immediately facing Mukhmas, on the opposite side of the ravine, is the modern representative of Geba, and behind this again are Ramah and Gibeah."},{"paragraph":"This was the scene of a great battle fought between the army of Saul and the Philistines, who were utterly routed and pursued for some 16 miles towards Philistia as far as the valley of Aijalon. \"The freedom of Benjamin secured at Michmash led through long years of conflict to the freedom of all its kindred tribes.\" The power of Benjamin and its king now steadily increased. A new spirit and a new hope were now at work in Israel. (See [399]SAUL.)"}]}
