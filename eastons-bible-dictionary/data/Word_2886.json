{"word":"Peleg","sections":[{"paragraph":"Division, one of the sons of Eber; so called because \"in his days was the earth divided\" (Gen. 10:25). Possibly he may have lived at the time of the dispersion from Babel. But more probably the reference is to the dispersion of the two races which sprang from Eber, the one spreading towards Mesopotamia and Syria, and the other southward into Arabia."}]}
