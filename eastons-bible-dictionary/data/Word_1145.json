He, with Medad, prophesied in the camp instead of going with the rest to the tabernacle, as Moses had commanded. This incident was announced to Moses by Joshua, who thought their conduct in this respect irregular. Moses replied, \"Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the Lord\u0027s people were prophets\" (Num. 11:24-30; comp. Mark 9:38; Luke 9:49)."}]}
