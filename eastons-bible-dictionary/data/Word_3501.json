The Hebrew word is from a root meaning \"to distil,\" and it has been by some interpreted as distilled myrrh. Others regard it as the gum of the storax tree, or rather shrub, the Styrax officinale. \"The Syrians value this gum highly, and use it medicinally as an emulcent in pectoral complaints, and also in perfumery.\""}]}
