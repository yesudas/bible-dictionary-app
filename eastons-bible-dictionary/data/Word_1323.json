{"word":"Ferret","sections":[{"paragraph":"Lev. 11:30 (R.V., \"gecko\"), one of the unclean creeping things. It was perhaps the Lacerta gecko which was intended by the Hebrew word (anakah, a cry, \"mourning,\" the creature which groans) here used, i.e., the \"fan-footed\" lizard, the gecko which makes a mournful wail. The LXX. translate it by a word meaning \"shrew-mouse,\" of which there are three species in Palestine. The Rabbinical writers regard it as the hedgehog. The translation of the Revised Version is to be preferred."}]}
