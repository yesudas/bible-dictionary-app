{"word":"Galilean","sections":[{"paragraph":"An inhabitant or native of Galilee. This word was used as a name of contempt as applied to our Lord\u0027s disciples (Luke 22:59; Acts 2:7). All the apostles, with the exception of Judas Iscariot (Acts 1:11), were Galileans. Peter was detected by his Galilean accent (Matt. 26:69; Mark 14:70)."},{"paragraph":"This was also one of the names of reproach given to the early Christians. Julian the Apostate, as he is called, not only used the epithet himself when referring to Christ and his apostles, but he made it a law that no one should ever call the Christians by any other name."}]}
