{"word":"Parlour","sections":[{"paragraph":"(from the Fr. parler, \"to speak\") denotes an \"audience chamber,\" but that is not the import of the Hebrew word so rendered. It corresponds to what the Turks call a kiosk, as in Judg. 3:20 (the \"summer parlour\"), or as in the margin of the Revised Version (\"the upper chamber of cooling\"), a small room built on the roof of the house, with open windows to catch the breeze, and having a door communicating with the outside by which persons seeking an audience may be admitted. While Eglon was resting in such a parlour, Ehud, under pretence of having a message from God to him, was admitted into his presence, and murderously plunged his dagger into his body (21, 22)."},{"paragraph":"The \"inner parlours\" in 1 Chr. 28:11 were the small rooms or chambers which Solomon built all round two sides and one end of the temple (1 Kings 6:5), \"side chambers;\" or they may have been, as some think, the porch and the holy place."},{"paragraph":"In 1 Sam. 9:22 the Revised Version reads \"guest chamber,\" a chamber at the high place specially used for sacrificial feasts."}]}
