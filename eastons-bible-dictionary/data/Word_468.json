{"word":"Bastard","sections":[{"paragraph":"In the Old Testament the rendering of the Hebrew word mamzer\u0027, which means \"polluted.\" In Deut. 23:2, it occurs in the ordinary sense of illegitimate offspring. In Zech. 9:6, the word is used in the sense of foreigner. From the history of Jephthah we learn that there were bastard offspring among the Jews (Judg. 11:1-7). In Heb. 12:8, the word (Gr. nothoi) is used in its ordinary sense, and denotes those who do not share the privileges of God\u0027s children."}]}
