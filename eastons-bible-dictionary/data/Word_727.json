{"word":"Carpenter","sections":[{"paragraph":"An artificer in stone, iron, and copper, as well as in wood (2 Sam. 5:11; 1 Chr. 14:1; Mark 6:3). The tools used by carpenters are mentioned in 1 Sam. 13:19, 20; Judg. 4:21; Isa. 10:15; 44:13. It was said of our Lord, \"Is not this the carpenter\u0027s son?\" (Matt. 13:55); also, \"Is not this the carpenter?\" (Mark 6:3). Every Jew, even the rabbis, learned some handicraft: Paul was a tentmaker. \"In the cities the carpenters would be Greeks, and skilled workmen; the carpenter of a provincial village could only have held a very humble position, and secured a very moderate competence.\""}]}
