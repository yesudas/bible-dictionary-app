{"word":"Slave","sections":[{"paragraph":"Jer. 2:14 (A.V.), but not there found in the original. In Rev. 18:13 the word \"slaves\" is the rendering of a Greek word meaning \"bodies.\" The Hebrew and Greek words for slave are usually rendered simply \"servant,\" \"bondman,\" or \"bondservant.\" Slavery as it existed under the Mosaic law has no modern parallel. That law did not originate but only regulated the already existing custom of slavery (Ex. 21:20, 21, 26, 27; Lev. 25:44-46; Josh. 9:6-27). The gospel in its spirit and genius is hostile to slavery in every form, which under its influence is gradually disappearing from among men."}]}
