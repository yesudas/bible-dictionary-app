{"word":"Crete","sections":[{"paragraph":"Now called Candia, one of the largest islands in the Meditterranean, about 140 miles long and 35 broad. It was at one time a very prosperous and populous island, having a \"hundred cities.\" The character of the people is described in Paul\u0027s quotation from \"one of their own poets\" (Epimenides) in his epistle to Titus: \"The Cretans are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies\" (Titus 1:12). Jews from Crete were in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:11). The island was visited by Paul on his voyage to Rome (Acts 27). Here Paul subsequently left Titus (1:5) \"to ordain elders.\" Some have supposed that it was the original home of the Caphtorim (q.v.) or Philistines."}]}
