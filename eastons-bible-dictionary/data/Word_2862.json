{"word":"Passage","sections":[{"paragraph":"Denotes in Josh. 22:11, as is generally understood, the place where the children of Israel passed over Jordan. The words \"the passage of\" are, however, more correctly rendered \"by the side of,\" or \"at the other side of,\" thus designating the position of the great altar erected by the eastern tribes on their return home. This word also designates the fords of the Jordan to the south of the Sea of Galilee (Judg. 12:5, 6), and a pass or rocky defile (1 Sam. 13:23; 14:4). \"Passages\" in Jer. 22:20 is in the Revised Version more correctly \"Abarim\" (q.v.), a proper name."}]}
