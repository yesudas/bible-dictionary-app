{"word":"Mixed multitude","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Ex. 12:38), a class who accompanied the Israelites as they journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, the first stage of the Exodus. These were probably miscellaneous hangers-on to the Hebrews, whether Egyptians of the lower orders, or the remains of the Hyksos (see [409]EGYPT; [410]MOSES), as some think. The same thing happened on the return of the Jews from Babylon (Neh. 13:3), a \"mixed multitude\" accompanied them so far."}]}
