{"word":"Chor-ashan","sections":[{"paragraph":"Smoking furnace, one of the places where \"David himself and his men were wont to haunt\" (1 Sam. 30:30, 31). It is probably identical with Ashan (Josh. 15:42; 19:7), a Simeonite city in the Negeb, i.e., the south, belonging to Judah. The word ought, according to another reading, to be \"Bor-ashan.\""}]}
