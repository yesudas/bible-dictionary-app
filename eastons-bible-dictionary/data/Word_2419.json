{"word":"Mark","sections":[{"paragraph":"The evangelist; \"John whose surname was Mark\" (Acts 12:12, 25). Mark (Marcus, Col. 4:10, etc.) was his Roman name, which gradually came to supersede his Jewish name John. He is called John in Acts 13:5, 13, and Mark in 15:39, 2 Tim. 4:11, etc."},{"paragraph":"He was the son of Mary, a woman apparently of some means and influence, and was probably born in Jerusalem, where his mother resided (Acts 12:12). Of his father we know nothing. He was cousin of Barnabas (Col. 4:10). It was in his mother\u0027s house that Peter found \"many gathered together praying\" when he was released from prison; and it is probable that it was here that he was converted by Peter, who calls him his \"son\" (1 Pet. 5:13). It is probable that the \"young man\" spoken of in Mark 14:51, 52 was Mark himself. He is first mentioned in Acts 12:25. He went with Paul and Barnabas on their first journey (about A.D. 47) as their \"minister,\" but from some cause turned back when they reached Perga in Pamphylia (Acts 12:25; 13:13). Three years afterwards a \"sharp contention\" arose between Paul and Barnabas (15:36-40), because Paul would not take Mark with him. He, however, was evidently at length reconciled to the apostle, for he was with him in his first imprisonment at Rome (Col. 4:10; Philemon 1:24). At a later period he was with Peter in Babylon (1 Pet. 5:13), then, and for some centuries afterwards, one of the chief seats of Jewish learning; and he was with Timothy in Ephesus when Paul wrote him during his second imprisonment (2 Tim. 4:11). He then disappears from view."}]}
