{"word":"Oven","sections":[{"paragraph":"Heb. tannur, (Hos. 7:4). In towns there appear to have been public ovens. There was a street in Jerusalem (Jer. 37:21) called \"bakers\u0027 street\" (the only case in which the name of a street in Jerusalem is preserved). The words \"tower of the furnaces\" (Neh. 3:11; 12:38) is more properly \"tower of the ovens\" (Heb. tannurim). These resemble the ovens in use among ourselves."},{"paragraph":"There were other private ovens of different kinds. Some were like large jars made of earthenware or copper, which were heated inside with wood (1 Kings 17:12; Isa. 44:15; Jer. 7:18) or grass (Matt. 6:30), and when the fire had burned out, small pieces of dough were placed inside or spread in thin layers on the outside, and were thus baked. (See [455]FURNACE.)"},{"paragraph":"Pits were also formed for the same purposes, and lined with cement. These were used after the same manner."},{"paragraph":"Heated stones, or sand heated by a fire heaped over it, and also flat irons pans, all served as ovens for the preparation of bread.
