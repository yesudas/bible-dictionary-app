{"word":"Beetle","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Heb. hargol, meaning \"leaper\"). Mention of it is made only in Lev. 11:22, where it is obvious the word cannot mean properly the beetle. It denotes some winged creeper with at least four feet, \"which has legs above its feet, to leap withal.\" The description plainly points to the locust (q.v.). This has been an article of food from the earliest times in the East to the present day. The word is rendered \"cricket\" in the Revised Version."}]}
