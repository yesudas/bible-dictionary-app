{"word":"Zelophehad","sections":[{"paragraph":"First-born, of the tribe of Manasseh, and of the family of Gilead; died in the wilderness. Having left no sons, his daughters, concerned lest their father\u0027s name should be \"done away from among his family,\" made an appeal to Moses, who, by divine direction, appointed it as \"a statute of judgment\" in Israel that daughters should inherit their father\u0027s portion when no sons were left (Num. 27:1-11). But that the possession of Zelophehad might not pass away in the year of jubilee from the tribe to which he belonged, it was ordained by Moses that his daughters should not marry any one out of their father\u0027s tribe; and this afterwards became a general law (Num. 36)."}]}
