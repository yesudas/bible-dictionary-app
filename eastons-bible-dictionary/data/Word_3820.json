{"word":"Wise men","sections":[{"paragraph":"Mentioned in Dan. 2:12 included three classes, (1) astrologers, (2) Chaldeans, and (3) soothsayers. The word in the original (hakamim) probably means \"medicine men. In Chaldea medicine was only a branch of magic. The \"wise men\" of Matt. 2:7, who came from the East to Jerusalem, were magi from Persia or Arabia."}]}
