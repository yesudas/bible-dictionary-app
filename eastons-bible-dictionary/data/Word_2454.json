{"word":"Meat-offering","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Heb. minhah), originally a gift of any kind. This Hebrew word came latterly to denote an \"unbloody\" sacrifice, as opposed to a \"bloody\" sacrifice. A \"drink-offering\" generally accompanied it. The law regarding it is given in Lev. 2, and 6:14-23. It was a recognition of the sovereignty of God and of his bounty in giving all earthly blessings (1 Chr. 29:10-14; Deut. 26:5-11). It was an offering which took for granted and was based on the offering for sin. It followed the sacrifice of blood. It was presented every day with the burnt-offering (Ex. 29:40, 41), and consisted of flour or of cakes prepared in a special way with oil and frankincense."}]}
