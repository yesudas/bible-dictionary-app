They were fastened by a lock (Judg. 3:23, 25; Cant. 5:5) or by a bar (Judg. 16:3; Job 38:10). In the interior of Oriental houses, curtains were frequently used instead of doors."},{"paragraph":"The entrances of the tabernacle had curtains (Ex. 26:31-33, 36). The \"valley of Achor\" is called a \"door of hope,\" because immediately after the execution of Achan the Lord said to Joshua, \"Fear not,\" and from that time Joshua went forward in a career of uninterrupted conquest. Paul speaks of a \"door opened\" for the spread of the gospel (1 Cor. 16:9; 2 Cor. 2:12; Col. 4:3). Our Lord says of himself, \"I am the door\" (John 10:9). John (Rev. 4:1) speaks of a \"door opened in heaven.\""}]}
