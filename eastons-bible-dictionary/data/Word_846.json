{"word":"Cleophas","sections":[{"paragraph":"(in the spelling of this word h is inserted by mistake from Latin MSS.), rather Cleopas, which is the Greek form of the word, while Clopas is the Aramaic form. In John 19:25 the Authorized Version reads, \"Mary, the wife of Clopas.\" The word \"wife\" is conjecturally inserted here. If \"wife\" is rightly inserted, then Mary was the mother of James the Less, and Clopas is the same as Alphaeus (Matt. 10:3; 27:56)."}]}
