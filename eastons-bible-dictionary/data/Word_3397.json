{"word":"Shoa","sections":[{"paragraph":"Opulent, the mountain district lying to the north-east of Babylonia, anciently the land of the Guti, or Kuti, the modern Kurdistan. The plain lying between these mountains and the Tigris was called su-Edina, i.e., \"the border of the plain.\" This name was sometimes shortened into Suti and Su, and has been regarded as \u003d Shoa (Ezek. 23:23). Some think it denotes a place in Babylon. (See [584]PEKOD.)"}]}
