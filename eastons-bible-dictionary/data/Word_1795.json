{"word":"Hivites","sections":[{"paragraph":"One of the original tribes scattered over Palestine, from Hermon to Gibeon in the south. The name is interpreted as \"midlanders\" or \"villagers\" (Gen. 10:17; 1 Chr. 1:15). They were probably a branch of the Hittites. At the time of Jacob\u0027s return to Canaan, Hamor the Hivite was the \"prince of the land\" (Gen. 24:2-28)."},{"paragraph":"They are next mentioned during the Conquest (Josh. 9:7; 11:19). They principally inhabited the northern confines of Western Palestine (Josh. 11:3; Judg. 3:3). A remnant of them still existed in the time of Solomon (1 Kings 9:20)."}]}
