{"word":"Convocation","sections":[{"paragraph":"A meeting of a religious character as distinguished from congregation, which was more general, dealing with political and legal matters. Hence it is called an \"holy convocation.\" Such convocations were the Sabbaths (Lev. 23:2, 3), the Passover (Ex. 12:16; Lev. 23:7, 8; Num. 28:25), Pentecost (Lev. 23:21), the feast of Trumpets (Lev. 23:24; Num. 29:1), the feast of Weeks (Num. 28:26), and the feast of Tabernacles (Lev. 23:35, 36). The great fast, the annual day of atonement, was \"the holy convocation\" (Lev. 23:27; Num. 29:7)."}]}
