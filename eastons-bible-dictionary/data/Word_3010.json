It comes from a root meaning \"to be like,\" \"parable.\" Rendered \"proverb\" in Isa. 14:4; Hab. 2:6; \"dark saying\" in Ps. 49:4, Num. 12:8. Ahab\u0027s defiant words in answer to the insolent demands of Benhadad, \"Let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off,\" is a well known instance of a proverbial saying (1 Kings 20:11)."}]}
