{"word":"Wheel","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Heb. galgal; rendered \"wheel\" in Ps. 83:13, and \"a rolling thing\" in Isa. 17:13; R.V. in both, \"whirling dust\"). This word has been supposed to mean the wild artichoke, which assumes the form of a globe, and in autumn breaks away from its roots, and is rolled about by the wind in some places in great numbers."}]}
