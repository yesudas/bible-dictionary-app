{"word":"Ships","sections":[{"paragraph":"Early used in foreign commerce by the Phoenicians (Gen. 49:13). Moses (Deut. 28:68) and Job (9:26) make reference to them, and Balaam speaks of the \"ships of Chittim\" (Num. 24:24). Solomon constructed a navy at Ezion-geber by the assistance of Hiram\u0027s sailors (1 Kings 9:26-28; 2 Chr. 8:18). Afterwards, Jehoshaphat sought to provide himself with a navy at the same port, but his ships appear to have been wrecked before they set sail (1 Kings 22:48, 49; 2 Chr. 20:35-37)."},{"paragraph":"In our Lord\u0027s time fishermen\u0027s boats on the Sea of Galilee were called \"ships.\" Much may be learned regarding the construction of ancient merchant ships and navigation from the record in Acts 27, 28."}]}
