{"word":"Cockatrice","sections":[{"paragraph":"The mediaeval name (a corruption of \"crocodile\") of a fabulous serpent supposed to be produced from a cock\u0027s egg. It is generally supposed to denote the cerastes, or \"horned viper,\" a very poisonous serpent about a foot long. Others think it to be the yellow viper (Daboia xanthina), one of the most dangerous vipers, from its size and its nocturnal habits (Isa. 11:8; 14:29; 59:5; Jer. 8:17; in all which the Revised Version renders the Hebrew tziph\u0027oni by \"basilisk\"). In Prov. 23:32 the Hebrew tzeph\u0027a is rendered both in the Authorized Version and the Revised Version by \"adder;\" margin of Revised Version \"basilisk,\" and of Authorized Version \"cockatrice.\""}]}
