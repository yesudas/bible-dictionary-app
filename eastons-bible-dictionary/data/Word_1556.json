{"word":"Grove","sections":[{"paragraph":"(1.) Heb. asherah, properly a wooden image, or a pillar representing Ashtoreth, a sensual Canaanitish goddess, probably usually set up in a grove (2 Kings 21:7; 23:4). In the Revised Version the word \"Asherah\" (q.v.) is introduced as a proper noun, the name of the wooden symbol of a goddess, with the plurals Asherim (Ex. 34:13) and Asheroth (Judg. 3:13)."},{"paragraph":"The LXX. have rendered asherah in 2 Chr. 15:16 by \"Astarte.\" The Vulgate has done this also in Judg. 3:7."},{"paragraph":"(2.) Heb. eshel (Gen. 21:33). In 1 Sam. 22:6 and 31:13 the Authorized Version renders this word by \"tree.\" In all these passages the Revised Version renders by \"tamarisk tree.\" It has been identified with the Tamariscus orientalis, five species of which are found in Palestine."},{"paragraph":"(3.) The Heb. word elon, uniformly rendered in the Authorized Version by \"plain,\" properly signifies a grove or plantation. In the Revised Version it is rendered, pl., \"oaks\" (Gen. 13:18; 14:13; 18:1; 12:6; Deut. 11:30; Josh. 19:33). In the earliest times groves are mentioned in connection with religious worship. The heathen consecrated groves to particular gods, and for this reason they were forbidden to the Jews (Jer. 17:3; Ezek. 20:28)."}]}
