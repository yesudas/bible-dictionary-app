{"word":"Halt","sections":[{"paragraph":"Lame on the feet (Gen. 32:31; Ps. 38:17). To \"halt between two opinions\" (1 Kings 18:21) is supposed by some to be an expression used in \"allusion to birds, which hop from spray to spray, forwards and backwards.\" The LXX. render the expression \"How long go ye lame on both knees?\" The Hebrew verb rendered \"halt\" is used of the irregular dance (\"leaped upon\") around the altar (ver. 26). It indicates a lame, uncertain gait, going now in one direction, now in another, in the frenzy of wild leaping."}]}
