{"word":"Cuthah","sections":[{"paragraph":"One of the Babylonian cities or districts from which Shalmaneser transplanted certain colonists to Samaria (2 Kings 17:24). Some have conjectured that the \"Cutheans\" were identical with the \"Cossaeans\" who inhabited the hill-country to the north of the river Choaspes. Cuthah is now identified with Tell Ibrahim, 15 miles north-east of Babylon."}]}
