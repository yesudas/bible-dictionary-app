In Matt. 26:69 and Mark 14:66 this word is incorrectly rendered \"palace\" in the Authorized Version, but correctly \"court\" in the Revised Version. In John 10:1, 16 it means a \"sheep-fold.\" In Matt. 27:27 and Mark 15:16 (A.V., \"common hall;\" R.V., \"palace\") it refers to the proetorium or residence of the Roman governor at Jerusalem. The \"porch\" in Matt. 26:71 is the entrance-hall or passage leading into the central court, which is open to the sky."}]}
