{"word":"Chiun","sections":[{"paragraph":"Occurs only in Amos 5:26 (R.V. marg., \"shrine\"). The LXX. translated the word by Rhephan, which became corrupted into Remphan, as used by Stephen (Acts 7:43; but R.V., \"Rephan\"). Probably the planet Saturn is intended by the name. Astrologers represented this planet as baleful in its influences, and hence the Phoenicians offered to it human sacrifices, especially children."}]}
