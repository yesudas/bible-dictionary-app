{"word":"Moriah","sections":[{"paragraph":"The chosen of Jehovah. Some contend that Mount Gerizim is meant, but most probably we are to regard this as one of the hills of Jerusalem. Here Solomon\u0027s temple was built, on the spot that had been the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite (2 Sam. 24:24, 25; 2 Chr. 3:1). It is usually included in Zion, to the north-east of which it lay, and from which it was separated by the Tyropoean valley. This was \"the land of Moriah\" to which Abraham went to offer up his son Isaac (Gen. 22:2). It has been supposed that the highest point of the temple hill, which is now covered by the Mohammedan Kubbetes-Sakhrah, or \"Dome of the Rock,\" is the actual site of Araunah\u0027s threshing-floor. Here also, one thousand years after Abraham, David built an altar and offered sacrifices to God. (See [417]JERUSALEM; NUMBERING THE [418]PEOPLE.)"}]}
