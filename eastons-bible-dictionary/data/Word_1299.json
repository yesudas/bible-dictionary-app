{"word":"Face","sections":[{"paragraph":"Means simply presence, as when it is recorded that Adam and Eve hid themselves from the \"face [R.V., presence\u0027] of the Lord God\" (Gen. 3:8; comp. Ex. 33:14, 15, where the same Hebrew word is rendered \"presence\"). The \"light of God\u0027s countenance\" is his favour (Ps. 44:3; Dan. 9:17). \"Face\" signifies also anger, justice, severity (Gen. 16:6, 8; Ex. 2:15; Ps. 68:1; Rev. 6:16). To \"provoke God to his face\" (Isa. 65:3) is to sin against him openly."},{"paragraph":"The Jews prayed with their faces toward the temple and Jerusalem (1 Kings 8:38, 44, 48; Dan. 6:10). To \"see God\u0027s face\" is to have access to him and to enjoy his favour (Ps. 17:15; 27:8). This is the privilege of holy angels (Matt. 18:10; Luke 1:19). The \"face of Jesus Christ\" (2 Cor. 4:6) is the office and person of Christ, the revealer of the glory of God (John 1:14, 18)."}]}
