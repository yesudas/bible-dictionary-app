{"word":"Light","sections":[{"paragraph":"The offspring of the divine command (Gen. 1:3). \"All the more joyous emotions of the mind, all the pleasing sensations of the frame, all the happy hours of domestic intercourse were habitually described among the Hebrews under imagery derived from light\" (1 Kings 11:36; Isa. 58:8; Esther 8:16; Ps. 97:11). Light came also naturally to typify true religion and the felicity it imparts (Ps. 119:105; Isa. 8:20; Matt. 4:16, etc.), and the glorious inheritance of the redeemed (Col. 1:12; Rev. 21:23-25). God is said to dwell in light inaccessible (1 Tim. 6:16). It frequently signifies instruction (Matt. 5:16; John 5:35). In its highest sense it is applied to Christ as the \"Sun of righteousness\" (Mal. 4:2; Luke 2:32; John 1:7-9). God is styled \"the Father of lights\" (James 1:17). It is used of angels (2 Cor. 11:14), and of John the Baptist, who was a \"burning and a shining light\" (John 5:35), and of all true disciples, who are styled \"the light of the world\" (Matt. 5:14)."}]}
