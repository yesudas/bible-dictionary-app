{"word":"Drunk","sections":[{"paragraph":"The first case of intoxication on record is that of Noah (Gen. 9:21). The sin of drunkenness is frequently and strongly condemned (Rom. 13:13; 1 Cor. 6:9, 10; Eph. 5:18; 1 Thess. 5:7, 8). The sin of drinking to excess seems to have been not uncommon among the Israelites."},{"paragraph":"The word is used figuratively, when men are spoken of as being drunk with sorrow, and with the wine of God\u0027s wrath (Isa. 63:6; Jer. 51:57; Ezek. 23:33). To \"add drunkenness to thirst\" (Deut. 29:19, A.V.) is a proverbial expression, rendered in the Revised Version \"to destroy the moist with the dry\", i.e., the well-watered equally with the dry land, meaning that the effect of such walking in the imagination of their own hearts would be to destroy one and all."}]}
