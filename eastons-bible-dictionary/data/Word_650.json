{"word":"Bridle","sections":[{"paragraph":"Three Hebrew words are thus rendered in the Authorized Version. (1.) Heb. mahsom\u0027 signifies a muzzle or halter or bridle, by which the rider governs his horse (Ps. 39:1)."},{"paragraph":"(2.) Me\u0027theg, rendered also \"bit\" in Ps. 32:9, which is its proper meaning. Found in 2 Kings 19:28, where the restraints of God\u0027s providence are metaphorically styled his \"bridle\" and \"hook.\" God\u0027s placing a \"bridle in the jaws of the people\" (Isa. 30:28; 37:29) signifies his preventing the Assyrians from carrying out their purpose against Jerusalem."},{"paragraph":"(3.) Another word, re\u0027sen, was employed to represent a halter or bridle-rein, as used Ps. 32:9; Isa. 30:28. In Job 30:11 the restraints of law and humanity are called a bridle."}]}
