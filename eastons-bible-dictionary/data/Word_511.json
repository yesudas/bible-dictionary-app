{"word":"Behemoth","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Job 40:15-24). Some have supposed this to be an Egyptian word meaning a \"water-ox.\" The Revised Version has here in the margin \"hippopotamus,\" which is probably the correct rendering of the word. The word occurs frequently in Scripture, but, except here, always as a common name, and translated \"beast\" or \"cattle.\""}]}
