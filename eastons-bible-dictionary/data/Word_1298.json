{"word":"Fable","sections":[{"paragraph":"Applied in the New Testament to the traditions and speculations, \"cunningly devised fables\", of the Jews on religious questions (1 Tim. 1:4; 4:7; 2 Tim. 4:4; Titus 1:14; 2 Pet. 1:16). In such passages the word means anything false and unreal. But the word is used as almost equivalent to parable. Thus we have (1) the fable of Jotham, in which the trees are spoken of as choosing a king (Judg. 9:8-15); and (2) that of the cedars of Lebanon and the thistle as Jehoash\u0027s answer to Amaziah (2 Kings 14:9)."}]}
