{"word":"Den","sections":[{"paragraph":"A lair of wild beasts (Ps. 10:9; 104:22; Job 37:8); the hole of a venomous reptile (Isa. 11:8); a recess for secrecy \"in dens and caves of the earth\" (Heb. 11:38); a resort of thieves (Matt. 21:13; Mark 11:17). Daniel was cast into \"the den of lions\" (Dan. 6:16, 17). Some recent discoveries among the ruins of Babylon have brought to light the fact that the practice of punishing offenders against the law by throwing them into a den of lions was common."}]}
