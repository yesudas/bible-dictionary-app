{"word":"Nail","sections":[{"paragraph":"For fastening. (1.) Hebrew yathed, \"piercing,\" a peg or nail of any material (Ezek. 15:3), more especially a tent-peg (Ex. 27:19; 35:18; 38:20), with one of which Jael (q.v.) pierced the temples of Sisera (Judg. 4:21, 22). This word is also used metaphorically (Zech. 10:4) for a prince or counsellor, just as \"the battle-bow\" represents a warrior."},{"paragraph":"(2.) Masmer, a \"point,\" the usual word for a nail. The words of the wise are compared to \"nails fastened by the masters of assemblies\" (Eccl. 12:11, A.V.). The Revised Version reads, \"as nails well fastened are the words of the masters,\" etc. Others (as Plumptre) read, \"as nails fastened are the masters of assemblies\" (comp. Isa. 22:23; Ezra 9:8). David prepared nails for the temple (1 Chr. 22:3; 2 Chr. 3:9). The nails by which our Lord was fixed to the cross are mentioned (John 20:25; Col. 2:14)."},{"paragraph":"Nail of the finger (Heb. tsipporen, \"scraping\"). To \"pare the nails\" is in Deut. 21:12 (marg., \"make,\" or \"dress,\" or \"suffer to grow\") one of the signs of purification, separation from former heathenism (comp. Lev. 14:8; Num. 8:7). In Jer. 17:1 this word is rendered \"point.\""}]}
