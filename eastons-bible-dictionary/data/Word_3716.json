{"word":"Treasury","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Matt. 27:6; Mark 12:41; John 8:20). It does not appear that there was a separate building so called. The name was given to the thirteen brazen chests, called \"trumpets,\" from the form of the opening into which the offerings of the temple worshippers were put. These stood in the outer \"court of the women.\" \"Nine chests were for the appointed money-tribute and for the sacrifice-tribute, i.e., money-gifts instead of the sacrifices; four chests for freewill-offerings for wood, incense, temple decoration, and burnt-offerings\" (Lightfoot\u0027s Hor. Heb.)."}]}
