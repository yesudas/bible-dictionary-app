{"word":"Gopher","sections":[{"paragraph":"A tree from the wood of which Noah was directed to build the ark (Gen. 6:14). It is mentioned only there. The LXX. render this word by \"squared beams,\" and the Vulgate by \"planed wood.\" Other versions have rendered it \"pine\" and \"cedar;\" but the weight of authority is in favour of understanding by it the cypress tree, which grows abundantly in Chaldea and Armenia."}]}
