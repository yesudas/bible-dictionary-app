{"word":"New Testament","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Luke 22:20), rather \"New Covenant,\" in contrast to the old covenant of works, which is superseded. \"The covenant of grace is called new; it succeeds to the old broken covenant of works. It is ever fresh, flourishing, and excellent; and under the gospel it is dispensed in a more clear, spiritual, extensive, and powerful manner than of old\" (Brown of Haddington). Hence is derived the name given to the latter portion of the Bible. (See [438]TESTAMENT.)"}]}
