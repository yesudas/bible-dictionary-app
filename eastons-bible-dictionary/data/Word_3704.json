{"word":"Torches","sections":[{"paragraph":"On the night of his betrayal, when our Lord was in the garden of Gethsemane, Judas, \"having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons\" (John 18:1-3). Although it was the time of full moon, yet in the valley of the Kidron \"there fell great, deep shadows from the declivity of the mountain and projecting rocks; there were there caverns and grottos, into which a fugitive might retreat; finally, there were probably a garden-house and tower, into whose gloom it might be necessary for a searcher to throw light around.\" Lange\u0027s Commentary. (Nahum 2:3, \"torches,\" Revised Version, \"steel,\" probably should be \"scythes\" for war-chariots.)"}]}
