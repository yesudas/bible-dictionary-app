{"word":"Sabaoth","sections":[{"paragraph":"The transliteration of the Hebrew word tsebha\u0027oth, meaning \"hosts,\" \"armies\" (Rom. 9:29; James 5:4). In the LXX. the Hebrew word is rendered by \"Almighty.\" (See Rev. 4:8; comp. Isa. 6:3.) It may designate Jehovah as either (1) God of the armies of earth, or (2) God of the armies of the stars, or (3) God of the unseen armies of angels; or perhaps it may include all these ideas."}]}
