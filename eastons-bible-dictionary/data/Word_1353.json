{"word":"Flea","sections":[{"paragraph":"David at the cave of Adullam thus addressed his persecutor Saul (1 Sam. 24:14): \"After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea?\" He thus speaks of himself as the poor, contemptible object of the monarch\u0027s pursuit, a \"worthy object truly for an expedition of the king of Israel with his picked troops!\" This insect is in Eastern language the popular emblem of insignificance. In 1 Sam. 26:20 the LXX. read \"come out to seek my life\" instead of \"to seek a flea.\""}]}
