{"word":"Lime","sections":[{"paragraph":"The Hebrew word so rendered means \"boiling\" or \"effervescing.\" From Isa. 33:12 it appears that lime was made in a kiln lighted by thorn-bushes. In Amos 2:1 it is recorded that the king of Moab \"burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime.\" The same Hebrew word is used in Deut. 27:2-4, and is there rendered \"plaster.\" Limestone is the chief constituent of the mountains of Syria."}]}
