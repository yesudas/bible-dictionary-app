{"word":"Ophrah","sections":[{"paragraph":"A fawn. 1 Chr. 4:14. (1.) A city of Benjamin (Josh. 18:23); probably identical with Ephron (2 Chr. 13:19) and Ephraim (John 11:54)."},{"paragraph":"(2.) \"Of the Abi-ezrites.\" A city of Manasseh, 6 miles south-west of Shechem, the residence of Gideon (Judg. 6:11; 8:27, 32). After his great victory over the Midianites, he slew at this place the captive kings (8:18-21). He then assumed the function of high priest, and sought to make Ophrah what Shiloh should have been. This thing \"became a snare\" to Gideon and his house. After Gideon\u0027s death his family resided here till they were put to death by Abimelech (Judg. 9:5). It is identified with Ferata."}]}
