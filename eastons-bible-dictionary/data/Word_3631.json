Abimelech led his army against this place, because of its participation in the conspiracy of the men of Shechem; but as he drew near to the strong tower to which its inhabitants had fled for safety, and was about to set fire to it, a woman cast a fragment of millstone at him, and \"all to brake his skull\" i.e., \"altogether brake,\" etc. His armourbearer thereupon \"thrust him through, and he died\" (Judg. 9:50-55)."}]}
