{"word":"Borrow","sections":[{"paragraph":"The Israelites \"borrowed\" from the Egyptians (Ex. 12:35, R.V., \"asked\") in accordance with a divine command (3:22; 11:2). But the word (sha\u0027al) so rendered here means simply and always to \"request\" or \"demand.\" The Hebrew had another word which is properly translated \"borrow\" in Deut. 28:12; Ps. 37:21. It was well known that the parting was final. The Egyptians were so anxious to get the Israelites away out of their land that \"they let them have what they asked\" (Ex. 12:36, R.V.), or literally \"made them to ask,\" urged them to take whatever they desired and depart. (See [73]LOAN.)"}]}
