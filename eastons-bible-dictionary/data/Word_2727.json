{"word":"Nicopolis","sections":[{"paragraph":"City of victory, where Paul intended to winter (Titus 3:12). There were several cities of this name. The one here referred to was most probably that in Epirus, which was built by Augustus Caesar to commemorate his victory at the battle of Actium (B.C. 31). It is the modern Paleoprevesa, i.e., \"Old Prevesa.\" The subscription to the epistle to Titus calls it \"Nicopolis of Macedonia\", i.e., of Thrace. This is, however, probably incorrect."}]}
