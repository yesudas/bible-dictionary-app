{"word":"Pharpar","sections":[{"paragraph":"Swift, one of the rivers of Damascus (2 Kings 5:12). It has been identified with the Awaj, \"a small lively river.\" The whole of the district watered by the Awaj is called the Wady el-Ajam, i.e., \"the valley of the Persians\", so called for some unknown reason. This river empties itself into the lake or marsh Bahret Hijaneh, on the east of Damascus. One of its branches bears the modern name of Wady Barbar, which is probably a corruption of Pharpar."}]}
