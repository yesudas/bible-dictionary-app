They had the right of gleaning the fields (Lev. 19:9, 10; Deut. 24:19, 21)."},{"paragraph":"(2.) In the sabbatical year they were to have their share of the produce of the fields and the vineyards (Ex. 23:11; Lev. 25:6)."},{"paragraph":"(3.) In the year of jubilee they recovered their property (Lev. 25:25-30)."},{"paragraph":"(4.) Usury was forbidden, and the pledged raiment was to be returned before the sun went down (Ex. 22:25-27; Deut. 24:10-13). The rich were to be generous to the poor (Deut. 15:7-11)."},{"paragraph":"(5.) In the sabbatical and jubilee years the bond-servant was to go free (Deut. 15:12-15; Lev. 25:39-42, 47-54)."},{"paragraph":"(6.) Certain portions from the tithes were assigned to the poor (Deut. 14:28, 29; 26:12, 13)."},{"paragraph":"(7.) They shared in the feasts (Deut. 16:11, 14; Neh. 8:10)."},{"paragraph":"(8.)

Begging was not common under the Old Testament, while it was so in the New Testament times (Luke 16:20, 21, etc.). But begging in the case of those who are able to work is forbidden, and all such are enjoined to \"work with their own hands\" as a Christian duty (1 Thess. 4:11; 2 Thess. 3:7-13; Eph. 4:28). This word is used figuratively in Matt. 5:3; Luke 6:20; 2 Cor. 8:9; Rev. 3:17."}]}
