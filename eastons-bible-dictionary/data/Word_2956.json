{"word":"Pine tree","sections":[{"paragraph":"Heb. tidhar, mentioned along with the fir-tree in Isa. 41:19; 60:13. This is probably the cypress; or it may be the stone-pine, which is common on the northern slopes of Lebanon. Some suppose that the elm, others that the oak, or holm, or ilex, is meant by the Hebrew word. In Neh. 8:15 the Revised Version has \"wild olive\" instead of \"pine.\" (See [490]FIR.)"}]}
