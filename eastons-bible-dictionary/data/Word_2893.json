{"word":"Pentecost","sections":[{"paragraph":"I.e., \"fiftieth\", found only in the New Testament (Acts 2:1; 20:16; 1 Cor. 16:8). The festival so named is first spoken of in Ex. 23:16 as \"the feast of harvest,\" and again in Ex. 34:22 as \"the day of the firstfruits\" (Num. 28:26). From the sixteenth of the month of Nisan (the second day of the Passover), seven complete weeks, i.e., forty-nine days, were to be reckoned, and this feast was held on the fiftieth day. The manner in which it was to be kept is described in Lev. 23:15-19; Num. 28:27-29. Besides the sacrifices prescribed for the occasion, every one was to bring to the Lord his \"tribute of a free-will offering\" (Deut. 16:9-11). The purpose of this feast was to commemorate the completion of the grain harvest. Its distinguishing feature was the offering of \"two leavened loaves\" made from the new corn of the completed harvest, which, with two lambs, were waved before the Lord as a thank offering."},{"paragraph":"The day of Pentecost is noted in the Christian Church as the day on which the Spirit descended upon the apostles, and on which, under Peter\u0027s preaching, so many thousands were converted in Jerusalem (Acts 2)."}]}
