{"word":"Sling","sections":[{"paragraph":"With a sling and a stone David smote the Philistine giant (1 Sam. 17:40, 49). There were 700 Benjamites who were so skilled in its use that with the left hand they \"could sling stones at a hair breadth, and not miss\" (Judg. 20:16; 1 Chr. 12:2). It was used by the Israelites in war (2 Kings 3:25). (See [597]ARMS.)"},{"paragraph":"The words in Prov. 26:8, \"As he that bindeth a stone in a sling,\" etc. (Authorized Version), should rather, as in the Revised Version, be \"As a bag of gems in a heap of stones,\" etc."}]}
