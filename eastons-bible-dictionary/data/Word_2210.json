{"word":"Kite","sections":[{"paragraph":"An unclean and keen-sighted bird of prey (Lev. 11:14; Deut. 14:13). The Hebrew word used, \u0027ayet, is rendered \"vulture\" in Job 28:7 in Authorized Version, \"falcon\" in Revised Version. It is probably the red kite (Milvus regalis), a bird of piercing sight and of soaring habits found all over Palestine."}]}
