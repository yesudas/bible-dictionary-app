{"word":"Demetrius","sections":[{"paragraph":"(1.) A silversmith at Ephesus, whose chief occupation was to make \"silver shrines for Diana\" (q.v.), Acts 19:24,i.e., models either of the temple of Diana or of the statue of the goddess. This trade brought to him and his fellow-craftsmen \"no small gain,\" for these shrines found a ready sale among the countless thousands who came to this temple from all parts of Asia Minor. This traffic was greatly endangered by the progress of the gospel, and hence Demetrius excited the tradesmen employed in the manufacture of these shrines, and caused so great a tumult that \"the whole city was filled with confusion.\""},{"paragraph":"(2.) A Christian who is spoken of as having \"a good report of all men, and of the truth itself\" (3 John 1:12)."}]}
