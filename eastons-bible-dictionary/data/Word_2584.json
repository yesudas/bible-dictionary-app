It was at that time in the possession of the Amorites (Num. 21:22). \"Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah,\" and \"died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord\" (Deut. 34:5, 6). \"Surely if we had nothing else to interest us in the land of Moab, the fact that it was from the top of Pisgah, its noblest height, this mightiest of the prophets looked out with eye undimmed upon the Promised Land; that it was here on Nebo, its loftiest mountain, that he died his solitary death; that it was here, in the valley over against Beth-peor, he found his mysterious sepulchre, we have enough to enshrine the memory in our hearts.\""}]}
