{"word":"Tabitha","sections":[{"paragraph":"(in Greek called Dorcas), gazelle, a disciple at Joppa. She was distinguished for her alms-deeds and good works. Peter, who was sent for from Lydda on the occasion of her death, prayed over the dead body, and said, \"Tabitha, arise.\" And she opened her eyes and sat up; and Peter \"gave her his hand, and raised her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive\" (Acts 9:36-43)."}]}
