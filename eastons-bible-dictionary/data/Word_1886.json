{"word":"Intercession of the Spirit","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Rom. 8:26, 27; John 14:26). \"Christ is a royal Priest (Zech. 6:13). From the same throne, as King, he dispenses his Spirit to all the objects of his care, while as Priest he intercedes for them. The Spirit acts for him, taking only of his things. They both act with one consent, Christ as principal, the Spirit as his agent. Christ intercedes for us, without us, as our advocate in heaven, according to the provisions of the everlasting covenant. The Holy Spirit works upon our minds and hearts, enlightening and quickening, and thus determining our desires \u0027according to the will of God,\u0027 as our advocate within us. The work of the one is complementary to that of the other, and together they form a complete whole.\", Hodge\u0027s Outlines of Theology."}]}
