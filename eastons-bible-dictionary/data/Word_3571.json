{"word":"Tahapanes","sections":[{"paragraph":"\u003dTahpanhes\u003dTehaphnehes, (called \"Daphne\" by the Greeks, now Tell Defenneh), an ancient Egyptian city, on the Tanitic branch of the Nile, about 16 miles from Pelusium. The Jews from Jerusalem fled to this place after the death of Gedaliah (q.v.), and settled there for a time (Jer. 2:16; 43:7; 44:1; 46:14). A platform of brick-work, which there is every reason to believe was the pavement at the entry of Pharaoh\u0027s palace, has been discovered at this place. \"Here,\" says the discoverer, Mr. Petrie, \"the ceremony described by Jeremiah [43:8-10; \"brick-kiln\", i.e., pavement of brick] took place before the chiefs of the fugitives assembled on the platform, and here Nebuchadnezzar spread his royal pavilion\" (R.V., \"brickwork\")."}]}
