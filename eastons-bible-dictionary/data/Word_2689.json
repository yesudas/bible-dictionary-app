{"word":"Neck","sections":[{"paragraph":"Used sometimes figuratively. To \"lay down the neck\" (Rom. 16:4) is to hazard one\u0027s life. Threatenings of coming judgments are represented by the prophets by their laying bands upon the people\u0027s necks (Deut. 28:48; Isa. 10:27; Jer. 27:2). Conquerors put their feet on the necks of their enemies as a sign of their subjection (Josh. 10:24; 2 Sam. 22:41)."}]}
