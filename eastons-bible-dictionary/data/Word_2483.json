{"word":"Meonenim","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Judg. 9:37; A.V., \"the plain of Meonenim;\" R.V., \"the oak of Meonenim\") means properly \"soothsayers\" or \"sorcerers,\" \"wizards\" (Deut. 18:10, 14; 2 Kings 21:6; Micah 5:12). This may be the oak at Shechem under which Abram pitched his tent (see [392]SHECHEM), the \"enchanter\u0027s oak,\" so called, perhaps, from Jacob\u0027s hiding the \"strange gods\" under it (Gen. 35:4)."}]}
