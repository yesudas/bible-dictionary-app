{"word":"Asherah","sections":[{"paragraph":"And pl. Asherim in Revised Version, instead of \"grove\" and \"groves\" of the Authorized Version. This was the name of a sensual Canaanitish goddess Astarte, the feminine of the Assyrian Ishtar. Its symbol was the stem of a tree deprived of its boughs, and rudely shaped into an image, and planted in the ground. Such religious symbols (\"groves\") are frequently alluded to in Scripture (Ex. 34:13; Judg. 6:25; 2 Kings 23:6; 1 Kings 16:33, etc.). These images were also sometimes made of silver or of carved stone (2 Kings 21:7; \"the graven image of Asherah,\" R.V.). (See [32]GROVE [1].)."}]}
