{"word":"Cornelius","sections":[{"paragraph":"A centurion whose history is narrated in Acts 10. He was a \"devout man,\" and like the centurion of Capernaum, believed in the God of Israel. His residence at Caesrea probably brought him into contact with Jews who communicated to him their expectations regarding the Messiah; and thus he was prepared to welcome the message Peter brought him. He became the first fruit of the Gentile world to Christ. He and his family were baptized and admitted into the Christian church (Acts 10:1, 44-48). (See [128]CENTURION.)"}]}
