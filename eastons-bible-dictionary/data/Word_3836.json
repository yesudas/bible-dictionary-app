{"word":"Worm","sections":[{"paragraph":"(1.) Heb. sas (Isa. 51:8), denotes the caterpillar of the clothes-moth."},{"paragraph":"(2.) The manna bred worms (tola\u0027im), but on the Sabbath there was not any worm (rimmah) therein (Ex. 16:20, 24). Here these words refer to caterpillars or larvae, which feed on corrupting matter."},{"paragraph":"These two Hebrew words appear to be interchangeable (Job 25:6; Isa. 14:11). Tola\u0027im in some places denotes the caterpillar (Deut. 28:39; Jonah 4:7), and rimmah, the larvae, as bred from putridity (Job 17:14; 21:26; 24:20). In Micah 7:17, where it is said, \"They shall move out of their holes like worms,\" perhaps serpents or \"creeping things,\" or as in the Revised Version, \"crawling things,\" are meant."},{"paragraph":"The word is used figuratively in Job 25:6; Ps. 22:6; Isa. 41:14; Mark 9:44, 46, 48; Isa. 66:24."}]}
