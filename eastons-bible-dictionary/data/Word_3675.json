{"word":"Tires","sections":[{"paragraph":"\"To tire\" the head is to adorn it (2 Kings 9:30). As a noun the word is derived from \"tiara,\" and is the rendering of the Heb. p\u0027er, a \"turban\" or an ornament for the head (Ezek. 24:17; R.V., \"headtire;\" 24:23). In Isa. 3:18 the word saharonim is rendered \"round tires like the moon,\" and in Judg. 8:21, 26 \"ornaments,\" but in both cases \"crescents\" in the Revised Version."}]}
