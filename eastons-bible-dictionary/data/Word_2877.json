{"word":"Peculiar","sections":[{"paragraph":"As used in the phrase \"peculiar people\" in 1 Pet. 2:9, is derived from the Lat. peculium, and denotes, as rendered in the Revised Version (\"a people for God\u0027s own possession\"), a special possession or property. The church is the \"property\" of God, his \"purchased possession\" (Eph. 1:14; R.V., \"God\u0027s own possession\")."}]}
