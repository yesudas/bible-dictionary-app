{"word":"Emims","sections":[{"paragraph":"Terrors, a warlike tribe of giants who were defeated by Chedorlaomer and his allies in the plain of Kiriathaim. In the time of Abraham they occupied the country east of Jordan, afterwards the land of the Moabites (Gen. 14:5; Deut. 2:10). They were, like the Anakim, reckoned among the Rephaim, and were conquered by the Moabites, who gave them the name of Emims, i.e., \"terrible men\" (Deut. 2:11). The Ammonites called them Zamzummims (2:20)."}]}
