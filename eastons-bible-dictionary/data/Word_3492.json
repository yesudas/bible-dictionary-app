{"word":"Spider","sections":[{"paragraph":"The trust of the hypocrite is compared to the spider\u0027s web or house (Job 8:14). It is said of the wicked by Isaiah that they \"weave the spider\u0027s web\" (59:5), i.e., their works and designs are, like the spider\u0027s web, vain and useless. The Hebrew word here used is \u0027akkabish, \"a swift weaver.\""},{"paragraph":"In Prov. 30:28 a different Hebrew word (semamith) is used. It is rendered in the Vulgate by stellio, and in the Revised Version by \"lizard.\" It may, however, represent the spider, of which there are, it is said, about seven hundred species in Palestine."}]}
