{"word":"Rosh","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Ezek. 38:2, 3; 39:1) is rendered \"chief\" in the Authorized Version. It is left untranslated as a proper name in the Revised Version. Some have supposed that the Russians are here meant, as one of the three Scythian tribes of whom Magog was the prince. They invaded the land of Judah in the days of Josiah. Herodotus, the Greek historian, says: \"For twenty-eight years the Scythians ruled over Asia, and things were turned upside down by their violence and contempt.\" (See [540]BETHSHEAN.)"}]}
