{"word":"Glede","sections":[{"paragraph":"An Old English name for the common kite, mentioned only in Deut. 14:13 (Heb. ra\u0027ah), the Milvus ater or black kite. The Hebrew word does not occur in the parallel passage in Leviticus (11:14, da\u0027ah, rendered \"vulture;\" in R.V., \"kite\"). It was an unclean bird. The Hebrew name is from a root meaning \"to see,\" \"to look,\" thus designating a bird with a keen sight. The bird intended is probably the buzzard, of which there are three species found in Palestine. (See [243]VULTURE.)"}]}
