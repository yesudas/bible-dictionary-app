{"word":"Night-hawk","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Heb. tahmas) occurs only in the list of unclean birds (Lev. 11:16; Deut. 14:15). This was supposed to be the night-jar (Caprimulgus), allied to the swifts. The Hebrew word is derived from a root meaning \"to scratch or tear the face,\" and may be best rendered, in accordance with the ancient versions, \"an owl\" (Strix flammea). The Revised Version renders \"night-hawk.\""}]}
