{"word":"Abraham\u0027s bosom","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Luke 16:22, 23) refers to the custom of reclining on couches at table, which was prevalent among the Jews, an arrangement which brought the head of one person almost into the bosom of the one who sat or reclined above him. To \"be in Abraham\u0027s bosom\" thus meant to enjoy happiness and rest (Matt. 8:11; Luke 16:23) at the banquet in Paradise. (See [8]banquet; [9]MEALS.)"}]}
