{"word":"Hosea","sections":[{"paragraph":"Salvation, the son of Beeri, and author of the book of prophecies bearing his name. He belonged to the kingdom of Israel. \"His Israelitish origin is attested by the peculiar, rough, Aramaizing diction, pointing to the northern part of Palestine; by the intimate acquaintance he evinces with the localities of Ephraim (5:1; 6:8, 9; 12:12; 14:6, etc.); by passages like 1:2, where the kingdom is styled the land\u0027, and 7:5, where the Israelitish king is designated as our\u0027 king.\" The period of his ministry (extending to some sixty years) is indicated in the superscription (Hos. 1:1, 2). He is the only prophet of Israel who has left any written prophecy."}]}
