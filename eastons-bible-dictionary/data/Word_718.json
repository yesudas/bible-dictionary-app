{"word":"Captain","sections":[{"paragraph":"(1.) Heb. sar (1 Sam. 22:2; 2 Sam. 23:19). Rendered \"chief,\" Gen. 40:2; 41:9; rendered also \"prince,\" Dan. 1:7; \"ruler,\" Judg. 9:30; \"governor,\u0027 1 Kings 22:26. This same Hebrew word denotes a military captain (Ex. 18:21; 2 Kings 1:9; Deut. 1:15; 1 Sam. 18:13, etc.), the \"captain of the body-guard\" (Gen. 37:36; 39:1; 41:10; Jer. 40:1), or, as the word may be rendered, \"chief of the executioners\" (marg.). The officers of the king\u0027s body-guard frequently acted as executioners. Nebuzar-adan (Jer. 39:13) and Arioch (Dan. 2:14) held this office in Babylon."},{"paragraph":"The \"captain of the guard\" mentioned in Acts 28:16 was the Praetorian prefect, the commander of the Praetorian troops."},{"paragraph":"(2.) Another word (Heb. katsin) so translated denotes sometimes a military (Josh. 10:24; Judg. 11:6, 11; Isa. 22:3 \"rulers;\" Dan. 11:18) and sometimes a civil command, a judge, magistrate, Arab. kady, (Isa. 1:10; 3:6; Micah 3:1, 9)."},{"paragraph":"(3.) It is also the rendering of a Hebrew word (shalish) meaning \"a third man,\" or \"one of three.\" The LXX. render in plural by tristatai; i.e., \"soldiers fighting from chariots,\" so called because each war-chariot contained three men, one of whom acted as charioteer while the other two fought (Ex. 14:7; 15:4; 1 Kings 9:22; comp. 2 Kings 9:25). This word is used also to denote the king\u0027s body-guard (2 Kings 10:25; 1 Chr. 12:18; 2 Chr. 11:11) or aides-de-camp."},{"paragraph":"(4.) The \"captain of the temple\" mentioned in Acts 4:1 and 5:24 was not a military officer, but superintendent of the guard of priests and Levites who kept watch in the temple by night.

The Captain of our salvation is a name given to our Lord (Heb. 2:10), because he is the author and source of our salvation, the head of his people, whom he is conducting to glory. The \"captain of the Lord\u0027s host\" (Josh. 5:14, 15) is the name given to that mysterious person who manifested himself to Abraham (Gen. 12:7), and to Moses in the bush (Ex. 3:2, 6, etc.) the Angel of the covenant.
