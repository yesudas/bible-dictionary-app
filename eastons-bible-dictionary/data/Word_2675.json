{"word":"Nazarene","sections":[{"paragraph":"This epithet (Gr. Nazaraios) is applied to Christ only once (Matt. 2:23). In all other cases the word is rendered \"of Nazareth\" (Mark 1:24; 10:47; 14:67, etc.). When this Greek designation was at first applied to our Lord, it was meant simply to denote the place of his residence. In course of time the word became a term of reproach. Thus the word \"Nazarene\" carries with it an allusion to those prophecies which speak of Christ as \"despised of men\" (Isa. 53:3). Some, however, think that in this name there is an allusion to the Hebrew netser, which signifies a branch or sprout. It is so applied to the Messiah (Isa. 11:1), i.e., he whom the prophets called the Netse, the \"Branch.\""},{"paragraph":"The followers of Christ were called \"the sect of Nazarenes\" (Acts 24:5). All over Palestine and Syria this name is still given to Christians. (See [429]NAZARETH.)"}]}
