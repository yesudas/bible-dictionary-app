{"word":"Ghost","sections":[{"paragraph":"An old Saxon word equivalent to soul or spirit. It is the translation of the Hebrew nephesh_ and the Greek _pneuma, both meaning \"breath,\" \"life,\" \"spirit,\" the \"living principle\" (Job 11:20; Jer. 15:9; Matt. 27:50; John 19:30). The expression \"to give up the ghost\" means to die (Lam. 1:19; Gen. 25:17; 35:29; 49:33; Job 3:11). (See HOLY [236]GHOST.)"}]}
