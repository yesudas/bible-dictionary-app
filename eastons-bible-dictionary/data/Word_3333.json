{"word":"Sheep-fold","sections":[{"paragraph":"A strong fenced enclosure for the protection of the sheep gathered within it (Num. 32:24; 1 Chr. 17:7; Ps. 50:9; 78:70). In John 10:16 the Authorized Version renders by \"fold\" two distinct Greek words, aule and poimne, the latter of which properly means a \"flock,\" and is so rendered in the Revised Version. (See also Matt. 26:31; Luke 2:8; 1 Cor. 9:7.) (See [578]FOLD.)"}]}
