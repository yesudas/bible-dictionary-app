{"word":"Beth-shean","sections":[{"paragraph":"House of security or rest, a city which belonged to Manasseh (1 Chr. 7:29), on the west of Jordan. The bodies of Saul and his sons were fastened to its walls. In Solomon\u0027s time it gave its name to a district (1 Kings 4:12). The name is found in an abridged form, Bethshan, in 1 Sam. 31:10, 12 and 2 Sam. 21:12. It is on the road from Jerusalem to Damascus, about 5 miles from the Jordan, and 14 from the south end of the Lake of Gennesaret. After the Captivity it was called Scythopolis, i.e., \"the city of the Scythians,\" who about B.C. 640 came down from the steppes of Southern Russia and settled in different places in Syria. It is now called Beisan."}]}
