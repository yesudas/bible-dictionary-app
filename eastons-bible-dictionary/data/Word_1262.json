He is said to have been also a priest of Astarte, whose worship was closely allied to that of Baal, and this may account for his daughter\u0027s zeal in promoting idolatry in Israel. This marriage of Ahab was most fatal to both Israel and Judah. Dido, the founder of Carthage, was his granddaughter."}]}
