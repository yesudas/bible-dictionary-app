{"word":"Berea","sections":[{"paragraph":"A city of Macedonia to which Paul with Silas and Timotheus went when persecuted at Thessalonica (Acts 17:10, 13), and from which also he was compelled to withdraw, when he fled to the sea-coast and thence sailed to Athens (14, 15). Sopater, one of Paul\u0027s companions belonged to this city, and his conversion probably took place at this time (Acts 20:4). It is now called Verria."}]}
