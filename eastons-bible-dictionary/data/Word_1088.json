{"word":"Dulcimer","sections":[{"paragraph":"(Heb. sumphoniah), a musical instrument mentioned in Dan. 3:5, 15, along with other instruments there named, as sounded before the golden image. It was not a Jewish instrument. In the margin of the Revised Version it is styled the \"bag-pipe.\" Luther translated it \"lute,\" and Grotius the \"crooked trumpet.\" It is probable that it was introduced into Babylon by some Greek or Western-Asiatic musician. Some Rabbinical commentators render it by \"organ,\" the well-known instrument composed of a series of pipes, others by \"lyre.\" The most probable interpretation is that it was a bag-pipe similar to the zampagna of Southern Europe."}]}
