{"word":"Hobab","sections":[{"paragraph":"Beloved, the Kenite, has been usually identified with Jethro (q.v.), Ex. 18:5, 27; comp. Num. 10:29, 30. In Judg. 4:11, the word rendered \"father-in-law\" means properly any male relative by marriage (comp. Gen. 19:14, \"son-in-law,\" A.V.), and should be rendered \"brother-in-law,\" as in the R.V. His descendants followed Israel to Canaan (Num. 10:29), and at first pitched their tents near Jericho, but afterwards settled in the south in the borders of Arad (Judg. 1:8-11, 16)."}]}
