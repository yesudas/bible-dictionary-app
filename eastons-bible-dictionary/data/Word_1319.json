The accusation was rendered nugatory by the influence of his brother Pallas with Nero. (See Josephus, Ant. xx. 8, 9.)"},{"paragraph":"Drusilla, the daughter of Herod Agrippa, having been induced by Felix to desert her husband, the king of Emesa, became his adulterous companion. She was seated beside him when Paul \"reasoned\" before the judge. When Felix gave place to Festus, being \"willing to do the Jews a pleasure,\" he left Paul bound."}]}
