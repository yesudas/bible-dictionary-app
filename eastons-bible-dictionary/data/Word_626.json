{"word":"Bosom","sections":[{"paragraph":"In the East objects are carried in the bosom which Europeans carry in the pocket. To have in one\u0027s bosom indicates kindness, secrecy, or intimacy (Gen. 16:5; 2 Sam. 12:8). Christ is said to have been in \"the bosom of the Father,\" i.e., he had the most perfect knowledge of the Father, had the closest intimacy with him (John 1:18). John (13:23) was \"leaning on Jesus\u0027 bosom\" at the last supper. Our Lord carries his lambs in his bosom, i.e., has a tender, watchful care over them (Isa. 40:11)."}]}
